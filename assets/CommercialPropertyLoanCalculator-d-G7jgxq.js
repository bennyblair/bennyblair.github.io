However, actual loan repayments may include additional costs like mortgage insurance, account fees, or property management costs that the calculator doesn't include. The calculator assumes consistent interest rates throughout the loan term, while variable rate loans fluctuate with market conditions. Use the calculator for planning and comparison purposes, then obtain formal loan quotes from lenders for exact repayment figures including all fees and charges specific to your circumstances."},{question:"Can I use the calculator for investment and owner-occupied properties?",answer:"Yes, the calculator works for both investment and owner-occupied commercial properties. The repayment calculations remain identical regardless of how you'll use the property. However, note that lenders may offer different interest rates for investment versus owner-occupied scenarios, and tax treatment differs significantly between the two. Investment property interest is tax-deductible, while owner-occupied interest generally isn't. Input the appropriate interest rate for your situation to get accurate repayment estimates for your specific use case."},{question:"What's the difference between interest-only and principal-and-interest calculations?",answer:"Interest-only calculations show the monthly cost of just the interest charges on your loan amount, with the principal remaining unchanged. Principal-and-interest calculations include both interest and gradual principal reduction, so your loan balance decreases over time. Interest-only results in lower monthly payments but you're not building equity through principal reduction. Most commercial property loans offer interest-only periods of 1-5 years before converting to principal-and-interest, requiring higher monthly payments after conversion."},{question:"How do I determine what interest rate to input?",answer:"Use interest rates that lenders have quoted you if you've already started shopping for loans. If you're in early planning stages, research current commercial property loan rates for your property type and borrower profile. Rates typically range from 6.5-8.5% depending on loan-to-value ratio, property quality, tenant strength, and your financial position. Prime properties with strong tenants and low LVRs achieve rates at the lower end, while higher-risk scenarios attract premium rates. Input a range of rates to see how rate differences affect your repayments."},{question:"Can the calculator help me decide between different loan terms?",answer:"Yes, comparing different loan terms is one of the calculator's most valuable uses. Input the same loan amount and interest rate but different loan terms (e.g., 15, 20, 25, 30 years) to see how term length affects monthly repayments and total interest costs. Shorter terms result in higher monthly payments but substantially lower total interest paid over the loan life. Longer terms reduce monthly payments but significantly increase total borrowing costs. Balance your cashflow needs against total cost minimization based on your investment strategy and holding period expectations."},{question:"Does the calculator account for fees and charges?",answer:"No, the calculator shows only principal and interest repayments, excluding establishment fees, legal fees, valuation costs, ongoing account fees, or other lender charges. These additional costs can add 1-3% upfront plus ongoing monthly fees. When planning your total borrowing costs, add these fees separately to the calculator outputs. Obtain detailed fee schedules from lenders to understand complete borrowing costs beyond the principal and interest figures the calculator provides."},{question:"How often should I recalculate when interest rates change?",answer:"Recalculate whenever you receive new rate quotes from lenders or when market interest rates change significantly (typically 0.5% or more). For variable rate loans, market rate movements affect your actual repayments, so recalculating every 3-6 months helps you stay informed about potential payment changes. If you're actively shopping for commercial property finance, recalculate each time you receive a formal loan offer to compare different lenders' terms accurately. Fixed rate loan holders don't need to recalculate during their fixed period unless planning refinancing."}];return e.jsxs(e.Fragment,{children:[e.jsxs($,{children:[e.jsx("title",{children:"Commercial Property Loan Calculator: Estimate Your Repayments | Emet Capital"}),e.jsx("meta",{name:"description",content:"Use our commercial property loan calculator to estimate repayments, compare rates, and plan your investment.

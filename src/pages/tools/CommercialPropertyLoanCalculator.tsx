      question: "How accurate is the commercial property loan calculator?",
      answer: "The calculator provides highly accurate repayment calculations using standard loan amortization formulas that lenders use. However, actual loan repayments may include additional costs like mortgage insurance, account fees, or property management costs that the calculator doesn't include. The calculator assumes consistent interest rates throughout the loan term, while variable rate loans fluctuate with market conditions. Use the calculator for planning and comparison purposes, then obtain formal loan quotes from lenders for exact repayment figures including all fees and charges specific to your circumstances."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the calculator for investment and owner-occupied properties?",
      answer: "Yes, the calculator works for both investment and owner-occupied commercial properties. The repayment calculations remain identical regardless of how you'll use the property. However, note that lenders may offer different interest rates for investment versus owner-occupied scenarios, and tax treatment differs significantly between the two. Investment property interest is tax-deductible, while owner-occupied interest generally isn't. Input the appropriate interest rate for your situation to get accurate repayment estimates for your specific use case."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between interest-only and principal-and-interest calculations?",
      answer: "Interest-only calculations show the monthly cost of just the interest charges on your loan amount, with the principal remaining unchanged. Principal-and-interest calculations include both interest and gradual principal reduction, so your loan balance decreases over time. Interest-only results in lower monthly payments but you're not building equity through principal reduction. Most commercial property loans offer interest-only periods of 1-5 years before converting to principal-and-interest, requiring higher monthly payments after conversion."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I determine what interest rate to input?",
      answer: "Use interest rates that lenders have quoted you if you've already started shopping for loans. If you're in early planning stages, research current commercial property loan rates for your property type and borrower profile. Rates typically range from 6.5-8.5% depending on loan-to-value ratio, property quality, tenant strength, and your financial position. Prime properties with strong tenants and low LVRs achieve rates at the lower end, while higher-risk scenarios attract premium rates. Input a range of rates to see how rate differences affect your repayments."
    },
    {
      question: "Can the calculator help me decide between different loan terms?",
      answer: "Yes, comparing different loan terms is one of the calculator's most valuable uses. Input the same loan amount and interest rate but different loan terms (e.g., 15, 20, 25, 30 years) to see how term length affects monthly repayments and total interest costs. Shorter terms result in higher monthly payments but substantially lower total interest paid over the loan life. Longer terms reduce monthly payments but significantly increase total borrowing costs. Balance your cashflow needs against total cost minimization based on your investment strategy and holding period expectations."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the calculator account for fees and charges?",
      answer: "No, the calculator shows only principal and interest repayments, excluding establishment fees, legal fees, valuation costs, ongoing account fees, or other lender charges. These additional costs can add 1-3% upfront plus ongoing monthly fees. When planning your total borrowing costs, add these fees separately to the calculator outputs. Obtain detailed fee schedules from lenders to understand complete borrowing costs beyond the principal and interest figures the calculator provides."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I recalculate when interest rates change?",
      answer: "Recalculate whenever you receive new rate quotes from lenders or when market interest rates change significantly (typically 0.5% or more). For variable rate loans, market rate movements affect your actual repayments, so recalculating every 3-6 months helps you stay informed about potential payment changes. If you're actively shopping for commercial property finance, recalculate each time you receive a formal loan offer to compare different lenders' terms accurately. Fixed rate loan holders don't need to recalculate during their fixed period unless planning refinancing."

              <p>
                Calculating commercial property loan repayments involves multiple variables that can dramatically affect your monthly obligations and total interest costs over time. A $2 million commercial property loan at 7% over 25 years costs $14,139 monthly, while the same loan at 8% costs $15,431 monthly—a $1,292 difference that compounds to $387,600 over the full term.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our commercial property loan calculator helps you model different scenarios before approaching lenders, enabling informed decisions about loan amounts, terms, and repayment structures. You can instantly compare interest-only versus principal-and-interest structures, evaluate how different interest rates affect affordability, and understand the total cost implications of various loan terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Understanding your potential repayments before applying for finance helps you assess investment viability, prepare realistic budgets, and identify optimal loan structures for your circumstances. This calculator provides the foundation for productive conversations with lenders and helps you set appropriate maximum purchase prices when evaluating commercial property opportunities.

                    <p className="text-sm">
                      The calculator requires four key inputs: loan amount (the total you're borrowing), interest rate (the annual percentage rate), loan term (duration in years), and repayment type (interest-only or principal-and-interest). Each variable significantly impacts your repayments and total costs.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-sm">
                      Loan amounts should reflect your actual borrowing requirements after accounting for your deposit. If you're purchasing a $3 million property with 30% deposit ($900,000), your loan amount is $2.1 million.

                      Interest-only repayments cover only the interest charges, leaving the principal unchanged. A $2 million loan at 7.5% interest-only costs $12,500 monthly, significantly less than principal-and-interest repayments on the same loan.

                    <p className="text-sm">
                      Principal-and-interest repayments include both interest and gradual principal reduction, building equity over time. The same $2 million loan at 7.5% over 25 years costs $14,777 monthly—$2,277 more than interest-only, but the loan balance decreases with each payment.

                  <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-3">
                    Lower loan-to-value ratios enable better interest rates, with lenders offering discounts for conservative borrowing. A loan at 60% LVR might receive 6.8% while 75% LVR attracts 7.8%—the 1% difference costing $14,000 annually on a $1.4 million loan.

                  <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                    Contributing additional deposit to reduce LVR often saves more in interest over time than the opportunity cost of deployed capital.

                    Office and industrial properties typically achieve better rates (6.5-7.5%) than retail properties (7-8.5%) reflecting lender risk perceptions. Prime CBD properties achieve rates 0.5-1.5% better than secondary locations regardless of property type.

                      Variable rate exposure creates risk if rates rise substantially. The calculator demonstrates that a 2% rate increase on $2 million variable loan increases repayments from $13,302 to $15,887 monthly—a $2,585 increase that could stress cashflow.

                Our commercial property loan calculator provides essential insights for planning property investments, comparing loan structures, and understanding total borrowing costs before committing to finance. By modeling different loan amounts, interest rates, terms, and repayment types, you can make informed decisions about affordable purchase prices, optimal loan structures, and realistic investment returns.
              </p>
              <p>
                The calculator reveals how seemingly small differences in interest rates or loan terms create substantial impacts on monthly repayments and total costs over time. A 1% interest rate difference or 5-year term variation can mean hundreds of thousands in additional costs, making careful loan structure selection critical for investment success.
              </p>
              <p>
                Use the calculator during property evaluation to assess whether potential purchases fit within your budget constraints and generate acceptable returns. Model various scenarios to understand how changing market conditions or different lender offers affect your financial position. The insights gained help you negotiate more effectively with lenders and make confident property acquisition decisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember that calculator outputs provide estimates for planning purposes—obtain formal loan quotes from lenders for exact repayment figures including all fees specific to your circumstances. Engage experienced finance brokers who can help you identify competitive loan offers and structure optimal finance arrangements for your commercial property investments.

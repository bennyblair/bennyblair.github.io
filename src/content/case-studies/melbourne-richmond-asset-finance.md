# Richmond Manufacturing: $850K Asset Finance for Production Equipment

When a Melbourne artisan pasta manufacturer identified an opportunity to supply two major supermarket chains, their existing equipment capacity couldn't meet the volume requirements. A $850K asset finance facility enabled the purchase of Italian production equipment without depleting working capital, scaling output 250% and generating $4.2M in new revenue within 18 months.

## The Business

**Location:** Richmond, Melbourne VIC - Inner-city manufacturing precinct  
**Business:** Artisan pasta and fresh food manufacturing  
**Established:** 12 years  
**Structure:** Family-owned, second-generation Italian business  
**Revenue:** $2.8M annually  
**Staff:** 18 employees (production, quality control, sales, logistics)  
**Customers:** Specialty food retailers, restaurants, delis, farmers markets

### Product Range

**Core Products:**
- Fresh pasta (ravioli, tortellini, lasagne sheets): 60% of revenue
- Dried pasta (artisan shapes, specialty grains): 25% of revenue
- Fresh sauces and pesto: 10% of revenue
- Wholesale to restaurants: 5% of revenue

**Production Capacity:**
- Existing: 3,000kg pasta per week
- Manual and semi-automated processes
- Limited by batch sizes and labor-intensive operations
- Single production line (12 hours daily operation)

**Market Position:**
- Premium quality, traditional Italian recipes
- Strong reputation in Melbourne specialty food scene
- Featured in major food media (Age Good Food, Broadsheet)
- Direct relationships with top-tier restaurants (Attica, Vue de Monde suppliers)

### Distribution Channels

**Current (Before Equipment Upgrade):**
- Direct to specialty retailers: 45% of sales
- Restaurant wholesale: 30% of sales
- Farmers markets (South Melbourne, Prahran): 15% of sales
- Online direct-to-consumer: 10% of sales

**Facility:**
- 800sqm warehouse in Richmond (near Bridge Road)
- Production area, cool room storage, packaging zone
- Loading dock for deliveries
- Close to MCG and Punt Road (good logistics access)

## The Growth Opportunity

### Major Supermarket Contract

**Opportunity:** National supermarket chain (600+ stores) approached to stock fresh pasta range  
**Initial Order:** $420K for 6-month trial across 180 Victorian stores  
**Ongoing:** Quarterly orders $800K-1.2M projected  
**Requirements:** Consistent volume, food safety certification, scalability

**Second Chain:** Regional supermarket (120 stores) also expressing interest  
**Combined Potential:** $4.8M annual revenue from supermarket channels alone

### Equipment Requirements

**Production Bottlenecks Identified:**
- Manual ravioli filling process: 250kg per day maximum
- Single pasta sheeting line: creating production queues
- Batch mixing limitations: constraining new product development
- Packaging speed: manual processes slowing output

**Solution Required:**
- Automated ravioli/tortellini production line (Italian-made)
- Second high-capacity pasta sheeting machine
- Commercial dough mixer (500L capacity)
- Automated portioning and packaging system
- Quality control and metal detection equipment

### Competitive Advantage

**Market Position:**

## Lessons for Manufacturing Businesses

### Asset Finance Considerations

1. **Equipment Selection:** Choose quality equipment with strong residual value
2. **Capacity Planning:** Size equipment for 3-5 year growth (not just immediate need)
3. **Supplier Relationships:** Established suppliers with warranty support essential
4. **Installation Planning:** Schedule downtime during seasonal low periods
5. **Training Investment:** Allocate budget for staff training on new equipment

### Success Factors

1. **Customer Contracts:** Secure agreements before major capital investment
2. **Working Capital:** Preserve cash for operations, use asset finance for equipment
3. **Quality Over Price:** Premium equipment = lower maintenance + higher uptime
4. **Market Diversification:** Balance major customers with smaller accounts
5. **Continuous Innovation:** Use capacity for new product development

### Manufacturing Risks

**Operational:**
- Equipment breakdown (downtime risk)
- Quality control issues (supermarket compliance)
- Labor availability (skilled machine operators)
- Supply chain disruptions (ingredient availability)

**Financial:**
- Customer concentration (over-reliance on supermarkets)
- Margin pressure (volume pricing negotiations)
- Working capital constraints (receivables timing)
- Equipment obsolescence (technology changes)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive insurance (equipment + business interruption)
- Maintenance contracts with equipment suppliers
- Quality management systems (HACCP, ISO certification)
- Customer diversification targets (max 40% any single customer)
- Regular equipment upgrades (technology refresh cycle)

- GST paid on equipment: $85K (claimed in next BAS)
- Cash flow benefit: Immediate GST recovery
- Monthly payments: GST-free (principal + interest)

**Total Tax Benefit:**
- Depreciation benefit: $148,750 (25% of $595K)
- Interest deduction benefit: $42,750
- Total 5-year tax benefit: $191,500
- Reduces effective cost of equipment to $658,500

### Comparison to Cash Purchase

**If Purchased with Cash ($850K):**
- Cash outlay: $850K (depletes working capital)
- Opportunity cost: Lost revenue from working capital shortage
- Tax benefit: Depreciation only ($148,750 over 5 years)

**Asset Finance ($850K over 5 years):**
- Upfront cost: $0 (preserves working capital)
- Working capital retained: $850K (generates additional revenue)
- Tax benefit: Depreciation + interest ($191,500 over 5 years)
- Additional revenue from preserved capital: Estimated $380K (supermarket contracts funded)

**Net Benefit of Asset Finance:**
- Preserved working capital enabling supermarket contracts
- Better tax position (interest deductibility)
- Cash flow matched to equipment revenue generation
- Risk mitigation (not depleting reserves)

## Future Growth Strategy

With successful equipment installation and supermarket relationships established, the business is pursuing:

**Short-term (Next 12 months):**
- Third supermarket chain contract (private label range)
- Export trials to Singapore and Hong Kong (premium positioning)
- Restaurant pre-portioned range (convenience + quality)
- Revenue target: $9.5M

**Medium-term (Years 2-3):**
- Second production line (additional $600K equipment investment)
- Interstate distribution (Sydney specialty retailers)
- Gluten-free dedicated production area (growing segment)
- Revenue target: $14M

**Long-term (Years 3-5):**
- Acquire smaller pasta manufacturer for capacity
- Establish dedicated export facility (Asian markets)
- Develop frozen meal range (pasta-based ready meals)
- Revenue target: $22M, potential strategic sale or partnership

## Asset Finance Facility Evolution

**Current Facility: $850K**
- Repayment: On track, 18 months completed
- Equipment performance: Exceeding expectations (uptime 97%)
- Maintenance: Comprehensive servicing program in place

**Future Requirements (Year 3):**
- Additional equipment: $600K for second production line
- Upgrade existing: $150K for automation enhancements
- Cold storage expansion: $220K (asset-backed available)

**Long-term Structure (Year 5+):**
- Refinance balloon payment or pay from cash reserves
- Trade-in existing equipment for technology upgrades
- Establish ongoing equipment finance relationship for growth
- Consider operating lease for rapidly evolving technology

## Conclusion

This Richmond case study demonstrates how asset finance enables capital-intensive manufacturing businesses to scale rapidly without depleting working capital. By financing $850K in Italian pasta equipment through a chattel mortgage, the business preserved cash reserves, secured major supermarket contracts, and generated $1.57M in additional profit within 18 months.

For manufacturing businesses in Melbourne and across Australia, asset finance provides the capital efficiency needed to invest in quality equipment, pursue growth opportunities, and compete in premium market segments. The tax benefits, working capital preservation, and flexible structures make asset finance essential for manufacturing growth strategies.

Melbourne's position as Australia's specialty food manufacturing hub, combined with growing consumer demand for premium and artisan products, ensures continued opportunities for manufacturers with the capacity and quality to serve major retail and export markets. Asset finance will remain critical for businesses seeking to capitalize on these opportunities.

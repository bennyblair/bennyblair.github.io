# Fortitude Valley Import Co: $1.2M Trade Finance for Asian Homeware

When a Brisbane import and wholesale business specializing in homewares from Vietnam, Thailand, and China identified major retail chain expansion opportunities, traditional working capital couldn't support the 3-4 month payment cycles required for overseas suppliers and shipping. A $1.2M trade finance facility enabled container purchases, strengthened supplier relationships, and scaled revenue from $3M to $9M in 18 months through the Port of Brisbane.

## The Business

**Location:** Fortitude Valley, Brisbane QLD - Central distribution and warehouse precinct  
**Business:** Import and wholesale of homewares, furniture, and décor  
**Established:** 6 years  
**Structure:** Family-owned, second-generation importers  
**Revenue:** $3.2M annually  
**Staff:** 8 employees (procurement, logistics, sales, warehouse)  
**Customers:** Independent retailers, online stores, interior designers, small chains

### Product Categories

**Import Sources:**
- Vietnam: Furniture, rattan products, textiles (40% of volume)
- China: Ceramics, lighting, decorative items (35% of volume)

**Distribution Channels:**

## The Growth Opportunity

**Initial Order:** $850K (8 containers) for Spring 2025 range  
**Ongoing:** Quarterly orders $600-800K  
**Payment Terms:** 60 days from delivery (standard retail chain terms)

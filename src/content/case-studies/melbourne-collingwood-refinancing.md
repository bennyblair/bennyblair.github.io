## The Debt Problem

Over 9 years of operations and growth, the group had accumulated eight separate loans and facilities:

**Average Interest Rate: 10.4% weighted average**  
**Total Monthly Payments: $23,555**  
**Annual Interest Cost: $200,600**

### The Problems

**1. Cash Flow Strain:**
- $23,555 monthly debt service = $282K annually
- Seasonal variations (summer slower, winter busy)
- Weekly cash flow shortfalls requiring overdraft
- Unable to invest in marketing or venue improvements

**2. High Interest Costs:**
- Weighted average rate 10.4% (industry average 7-8%)
- Some facilities at 15-19% (unsustainable)
- $200K+ annual interest expense (3% of revenue)
- Limiting profitability and reducing owner returns

**3. Multiple Lenders = Administrative Burden:**
- 8 different payment dates per month
- Different documentation requirements
- Multiple reporting obligations
- Director time spent managing debt (not business)

**4. Relationship Issues:**
- Primary bank relationship deteriorated during pandemic
- Limited growth funding available from bank
- Personal guarantees causing stress
- Covenants restricting business decisions

**5. Growth Limitations:**
- Fourth venue opportunity identified (Fitzroy site)
- No capacity to fund expansion with existing debt load
- Potential investors concerned by complex debt structure
- Limiting strategic options

## The Challenge

**Refinancing Requirements:**
- Consolidate all 8 facilities into single loan
- Reduce interest rate to competitive level (7-8%)
- Maintain or improve cash flow (reduce monthly payments)
- Release some personal guarantees where possible
- Structure for future growth (fourth venue)

### Specific Hurdles

1. **Complex Debt Structure:** Multiple lenders, different security, varying terms
2. **Pandemic Stigma:** Lenders concerned about hospitality sector post-COVID
3. **Property Security:** Flagship restaurant on leasehold (not freehold title)
4. **Equipment Age:** Some equipment near end of useful life
5. **Personal Guarantees:** Directors wanting to reduce personal exposure
6. **Timing:** Needed refinancing quickly to secure fourth venue opportunity

## The Emet Capital Solution

**Purpose:** Consolidate all 8 loans + $100K working capital  
**Structure:** Single commercial loan secured by business assets + property leases  
**Term:** 7 years (reducing to 5 if fourth venue proceeds)  
**Interest Rate:** 7.6% p.a. (2.8% lower than weighted average)  
**Monthly Payment:** $18,750 (vs $23,555 previously)  
**Approval Time:** 8 business days from application to formal approval

### Refinancing Structure

### Interest Rate Comparison

- Plus fees and account keeping: $12,400 annually
- **Total cost of debt:** $213,000 per year

- $2,100K @ 7.6% p.a. = $159,600 annual interest

## Lessons for Hospitality Businesses

### Refinancing Considerations

1. **Timing:** Review debt annually, refinance when rates justify (>2% savings)
2. **Consolidation:** Simplify to single facility where possible
3. **Interest Rates:** Negotiate based on business performance (not historical distress)
4. **Personal Guarantees:** Reduce exposure as business matures
5. **Working Capital:** Build buffer into refinancing (seasonal cash flow)

### Success Factors

1. **Strong Operations:** Profitable venues essential for refinancing approval
2. **Multiple Venues:** Diversification reduces risk (single venue riskier)
3. **Brand Strength:** Media coverage and awards improve lending terms
4. **Financial Records:** Clean bookkeeping critical for approval
5. **Growth Plan:** Clear strategy improves confidence and terms

### Hospitality Risks

**Mitigation Strategies:**

# The Junction Medical Centre: $2.4M SMSF Property Purchase

When three medical professionals operating a successful general practice in Newcastle's Junction identified their landlord was selling their clinic premises, they saw an opportunity to eliminate rent costs while building retirement wealth. SMSF limited recourse lending enabled their superannuation funds to purchase the property collectively, reducing operating costs by $180K annually while creating a valuable retirement asset.

## The Medical Practice

**Location:** The Junction, Newcastle NSW - Premium residential and medical precinct  
**Business:** General medical practice (bulk billing and private consultations)  
**Established:** 12 years in current premises  
**Doctors:** 3 GP partners + 2 visiting specialists  
**Staff:** 7 nurses, 3 reception/admin  
**Revenue:** $2.8M annually  
**Patients:** 6,200 active patients in practice catchment

### The Property Opportunity

**Property:** Purpose-built medical centre (450sqm)  
**Features:**
- 8 consulting rooms
- Minor procedures room
- Pathology collection point
- Dedicated parking (12 spaces)
- Ground floor accessibility
- Recently renovated ($200K fit-out)

**Location Benefits:**
- High-traffic corner site on Darby Street
- 500m from Newcastle Beach
- Residential catchment: 25,000 people within 2km
- Established medical precinct (5 practices within 400m)

**Current Arrangement:** 7-year commercial lease @ $160K pa + outgoings ($20K)  
**Landlord Situation:** Selling to fund interstate move  
**Market Value:** $3.6M (yields 4.4% net)

## The Strategic Rationale

### Financial Benefits of Ownership

**Immediate Advantages:**
- Eliminate $180K annual rent and outgoings ($1.8M over 10 years)
- Rent savings exceed loan repayments
- Build equity in appreciating commercial property
- Secure tenure for practice continuity

**Long-term Wealth Creation:**
- Commercial property: Historical appreciation 5-7% annually in Newcastle medical precincts
- Combined superannuation balance increase through property investment
- Retirement asset providing income or sale proceeds at wind-up
- Tax-advantaged structure through SMSF (15% tax vs marginal rates 39-47%)

**Practice Security:**
- Control over premises and lease terms
- No risk of rent increases or non-renewal
- Ability to customize premises without landlord approval
- Asset diversification beyond shares and managed funds

### SMSF Structure Benefits

**Tax Advantages:**
- SMSF pays 15% tax on rental income (vs 39-47% personal tax)
- Capital gains tax: 10% if held 12+ months (vs 23.5-47% personally)
- Pension phase: 0% tax on rental income and capital gains
- Negative gearing benefits within SMSF structure

**Estate Planning:**
- Commercial property passes to beneficiaries tax-effectively
- Death benefit nominations provide certainty
- Flexibility in practice succession planning

## The Challenge

**Purchase Price:** $3.6M  
**SMSF Available Funds:** Combined balances of 3 SMSF funds = $1.5M  
**Financing Required:** $2.4M  
**Structure Complexity:** Three separate SMSFs purchasing property jointly  
**Timeframe:** 8 weeks before property listed publicly

### Specific Hurdles

1. **Limited Recourse Requirement:** SMSF lending must be limited recourse (lender's only claim is property)
2. **Compliance Complexity:** Sole purpose test, related party transactions, commercial lease terms
3. **Three-Party Structure:** Joint ownership requiring unitized trust structure
4. **Valuation Requirements:** Independent valuation and market rent assessment
5. **Regulatory Documentation:** SMSF deed amendments, trustee resolutions, compliance certificates
6. **Lease Structure:** Arms-length commercial lease from SMSFs to medical practice

## The Emet Capital Solution

**Facility Amount:** $2.4M SMSF limited recourse loan  
**Structure:** Joint borrowing by 3 SMSFs through unitized property trust  
**Term:** 15 years  
**Interest Rate:** 6.2% fixed for 5 years  
**Repayments:** $20,400 per month (covered by commercial rent from practice)  
**LVR:** 65% (conservative given medical property quality)  
**Security:** Limited recourse mortgage over medical centre only  
**Approval Time:** 12 business days from application to conditional approval

### SMSF Lending Structure

**Ownership Structure:**
- Bare trust holds legal title to property
- 3 SMSFs own units in bare trust (proportional to contribution)
- Dr. A SMSF: 45% ($600K contribution)
- Dr. B SMSF: 35% ($500K contribution)
- Dr. C SMSF: 20% ($400K contribution)

**Limited Recourse Terms:**
- Lender's recourse limited to property only (cannot claim against other SMSF assets)
- No personal guarantees from SMSF members
- Default risk isolated to property

**Commercial Lease:**
- Medical practice leases property from SMSFs
- Market rent: $180K pa (independently assessed)
- 10-year lease term with 2 x 5-year options
- 3% annual increases (CPI-linked)
- Commercial terms at arm's length (regulatory requirement)

**Cash Flow:**
- Practice pays $180K rent to SMSFs annually
- SMSFs pay $244,800 loan repayments annually
- Net SMSF contribution required: $64,800 pa (split proportionally)
- Funded from mandatory superannuation contributions and voluntary contributions

### Why SMSF Lending Was Essential

1. **Retirement Wealth:** Build equity in appreciating asset within superannuation
2. **Tax Efficiency:** 15% tax vs 39-47% on income and capital gains
3. **Practice Security:** Ownership eliminates landlord risk
4. **Limited Recourse:** Protects other SMSF assets from default risk
5. **Professional Structure:** Lender experience with medical property SMSF transactions

## Future Strategy

With successful SMSF property purchase and 3-year track record, the partners are considering:

**Short-term (Next 2 years):**

- Explore specialist tenancies in underutilized space
- Review insurance and risk management

**Medium-term (Years 3-5):**
- Second SMSF property investment in different location
- Practice expansion into adjacent premises
- Succession planning for eventual practice sale
- Consider converting part of loan to interest-only as balances grow

**Long-term (Years 5-10):**
- Transition partners to retirement and pension phase
- Practice succession: Sell to incoming doctors or corporate buyer
- Retain property ownership generating retirement income
- Estate planning for property transfer to beneficiaries

## Conclusion

This Junction case study demonstrates how SMSF limited recourse lending enables medical professionals to convert rent payments into retirement wealth while maintaining practice security and financial flexibility. By purchasing their premises through superannuation, the three doctors eliminated $180K annual rent, built $550K equity in 3 years, and created a valuable retirement asset projected to be worth $6.8M over 15 years.

For medical practitioners in Newcastle and regional centers, SMSF property purchases offer a tax-effective pathway to retirement wealth creation while providing practice security and operational control. The key is early professional advice, strong SMSF balances, and commitment to long-term ownership aligned with retirement planning.

Newcastle's growing population, aging demographic, and constrained supply of quality medical premises ensure continued strong demand for healthcare services and medical property. SMSF property ownership will continue to be an attractive strategy for established medical professionals seeking to build retirement wealth while securing their practice premises.

# Surry Hills Restaurant Acquisition: $3.2M Caveat Loan Success

When an experienced restaurateur identified a prime opportunity in Surry Hills' thriving food scene, time was of the essence. The coveted corner location in one of Sydney's most sought-after dining precincts required immediate action to secure the lease and begin fit-out works.

## The Opportunity

**Location:** Crown Street, Surry Hills - Sydney's culinary heart
**Property Type:** Ground floor commercial space with street frontage
**Size:** 180 sqm with outdoor dining potential
**Previous Use:** Established restaurant with existing kitchen infrastructure

The client, with over 15 years in Sydney's hospitality industry, had identified this location as perfect for their new concept restaurant. Located in the heart of Surry Hills, just minutes from Sydney CBD, the property offered:

- High foot traffic from both local residents and tourists
- Proximity to major hotels and business districts
- Established dining precinct with complementary businesses
- Existing restaurant infrastructure reducing fit-out costs

## The Challenge

**Time Pressure:** Settlement required within 48 hours
**Competition:** Multiple parties interested in the premium location
**Funding Gap:** Traditional bank financing would take 4-6 weeks
**Market Conditions:** Rising commercial rents in inner Sydney

The client needed to act fast. Bank financing, even if pre-approved, wouldn't settle in time. The vendor had received multiple offers and was prioritizing speed of settlement over marginally higher prices.

## The Emet Capital Solution

**Loan Amount:** $3.2 million
**Loan Type:** First registered caveat loan
**LVR:** 75% against property valuation
**Settlement:** 48 hours from application
**Security:** Commercial property at 156 Crown Street, Surry Hills

### Why Caveat Lending Was Perfect

1. **Speed:** Documentation and settlement within 48 hours
2. **Certainty:** No lengthy bank approval processes
3. **Flexibility:** Structured around the client's business plan
4. **Local Knowledge:** Understanding of Surry Hills property values

### The Process

**Day 2 (Tuesday):**

## The Outcome

### Immediate Results

## Lessons Learned

### For Borrowers
1. **Speed Matters:** In competitive markets, settlement speed can be worth more than price

# Surry Hills Restaurant Acquisition: $3.2M Caveat Loan Success

When an experienced restaurateur identified a prime opportunity in Surry Hills' thriving food scene, time was of the essence. The coveted corner location in one of Sydney's most sought-after dining precincts required immediate action to secure the lease and begin fit-out works.

## The Opportunity

**Location:** Crown Street, Surry Hills - Sydney's culinary heart
**Property Type:** Ground floor commercial space with street frontage
**Size:** 180 sqm with outdoor dining potential
**Previous Use:** Established restaurant with existing kitchen infrastructure

The client, with over 15 years in Sydney's hospitality industry, had identified this location as perfect for their new concept restaurant. Located in the heart of Surry Hills, just minutes from Sydney CBD, the property offered:

- High foot traffic from both local residents and tourists
- Proximity to major hotels and business districts
- Established dining precinct with complementary businesses
- Existing restaurant infrastructure reducing fit-out costs

## The Challenge

**Time Pressure:** Settlement required within 48 hours
**Competition:** Multiple parties interested in the premium location
**Funding Gap:** Traditional bank financing would take 4-6 weeks
**Market Conditions:** Rising commercial rents in inner Sydney

The client needed to act fast. Bank financing, even if pre-approved, wouldn't settle in time. The vendor had received multiple offers and was prioritizing speed of settlement over marginally higher prices.

## The Emet Capital Solution

**Loan Amount:** $3.2 million
**Loan Type:** First registered caveat loan
**LVR:** 75% against property valuation
**Settlement:** 48 hours from application
**Security:** Commercial property at 156 Crown Street, Surry Hills

### Why Caveat Lending Was Perfect

1. **Speed:** Documentation and settlement within 48 hours
2. **Certainty:** No lengthy bank approval processes
3. **Flexibility:** Structured around the client's business plan
4. **Local Knowledge:** Understanding of Surry Hills property values

### The Process

- Initial consultation and property assessment
- Valuation arranged with local commercial valuer

**Day 2 (Tuesday):**
- Valuation confirmed at $4.3M
- Legal searches completed

**Day 3 (Wednesday):**

## The Outcome

### Immediate Results
- **Settlement:** Completed within 48-hour deadline

- **Employment:** Created 25 full-time local jobs
- **Community Impact:** Contributed to Surry Hills dining renaissance

## Market Context: Surry Hills Commercial Property

**Location Advantages:**
- 2km from Sydney CBD
- Excellent public transport links
- Growing residential population
- Established creative and professional community

**Commercial Property Trends:**
- Ground floor retail: $1,200-2,000 per sqm annually
- Restaurant spaces: Premium locations command 20-30% above base rates
- Vacancy rates: Consistently below 3% for quality spaces
- Capital growth: 15% annually over past 3 years

## Lessons Learned

### For Borrowers
1. **Speed Matters:** In competitive markets, settlement speed can be worth more than price
2. **Local Expertise:** Understanding micro-markets like Surry Hills is crucial
3. **Alternative Funding:** Caveat loans bridge the gap between opportunity and traditional finance
4. **Business Planning:** Strong business plans support faster lending decisions

### For the Market
This case demonstrates the vital role of alternative lending in Sydney's competitive commercial property market. Traditional banks, while cost-effective, often can't match the speed required in prime locations.

## About the Location

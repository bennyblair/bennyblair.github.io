# Merewether Medical Clinic: $850K Equipment Finance Success

When a well-established medical practice in Newcastle's coastal suburb of Merewether identified the need to upgrade aging diagnostic equipment and expand specialist services, they faced a common dilemma: invest capital in equipment or preserve cash flow for operations. Equipment finance provided the solution, enabling growth without compromising financial stability.

# Gold Coast Surfers Paradise: $650K Second Mortgage for Beachfront Development Deposit

When a seasoned Gold Coast developer found a rare beachfront site in Surfers Paradise, their capital was locked in an existing project with 6 months to completion. A $650K second mortgage against their Broadbeach investment property provided the deposit needed to secure the site—without disturbing their existing bank facility. The project is now under construction with $4.2M profit projected.

## The Developer

**Location:** Gold Coast, Queensland  
**Background:** Experienced residential developer  
**Experience:** 18 years developing on the Gold Coast  
**Structure:** Development company + family trust  
**Completed Projects:** 14 developments (380+ apartments/townhouses)  
**Current Portfolio:** 2 investment properties + 1 active development

### Development Track Record

**Recent Projects:**
- Burleigh Heads: 28 apartments (2023) - $3.1M profit
- Southport: 45 townhouses (2022) - $4.8M profit
- Mermaid Beach: 18 luxury apartments (2021) - $2.6M profit
- Palm Beach: 32 apartments (2020) - $2.9M profit

**Development Philosophy:**
- Beachside locations only (east of Gold Coast Highway)
- Boutique scale (20-50 units)
- Owner-occupier focus (premium finishes)
- Pre-sales before construction
- Joint venture with established builders

### The Opportunity

**Site Details:**
- Address: Esplanade, Surfers Paradise
- Land area: 1,012sqm
- Zoning: High-density residential
- Frontage: 22m to Esplanade (ocean views)
- Depth: 46m
- Current use: Older 12-unit walk-up (1970s)
- Proposed: 42-unit residential tower (15 levels)

**Financial Profile:**
- Asking price: $18.5M
- Negotiated price: $18.5M (no discount—multiple buyers competing)
- Comparable site sales: $17,000-20,000/sqm
- This site: $18,280/sqm (reasonable given beachfront)
- **Required deposit: $1.85M (10%)**

**Development Potential:**
- Gross realisable value (GRV): $68M
- Development cost (construction + fees): $41M
- Land cost: $18.5M
- **Projected profit: $8.5M (before interest)**
- **Net profit (after finance costs): $4.2M**
- Development margin: 12.5% (on GRV)
- Return on equity: 42%

## The Problem

### Capital Locked in Active Development

The developer had an active project in Broadbeach:

**Broadbeach Development Status:**
- 36-unit apartment building
- Construction: 65% complete
- Completion: 6 months away
- Pre-sales: 31/36 (86%)
- Expected profit: $3.4M
- Developer's equity in project: $2.1M (returning on completion)

**Cash Position:**
- Available cash: $1.2M
- Required deposit: $1.85M
- **Shortfall: $650,000**

### Why Refinancing Wasn't an Option

The developer owned a Broadbeach investment apartment with significant equity:

**Broadbeach Investment Property:**
- Current value: $1.85M
- Existing first mortgage: $980K (53% LVR)
- Available equity: $870K
- Bank: Major bank (NAB)

**Refinancing Challenges:**
1. **Timing:** Bank refinance would take 6-8 weeks (site exchange in 14 days)
2. **Costs:** Break costs on fixed-rate portion: $28,000
3. **Bank Policy:** Developer classification triggered stricter assessment
4. **LVR Cap:** Bank would only go to 60% LVR for developers
5. **Disruption:** Changing facilities during active development causes complications

### Competing Buyers

**Market Pressure:**
- 3 other developers inspecting the site
- Interstate developer had expressed strong interest
- Vendor wanted unconditional contract (or 10% deposit with minimal conditions)
- Expected to sell within 2 weeks if this buyer didn't proceed
- **No room for finance clause—deposit had to be cash unconditional**

### Time Pressure

**Critical Dates:**
- Site identified: January 5
- Verbal offer accepted: January 8
- Contract deadline: January 19 (14 days)
- Deposit due: On exchange
- Settlement: 90 days after exchange

**The Problem:**
- Bank refinance: 6-8 weeks
- Available time: 14 days
- **Gap: 4-6 weeks**

## The Emet Capital Solution

**Facility Amount:** $650K second mortgage  
**Security:** Second-ranking mortgage over Broadbeach investment property  
**First Mortgage:** NAB (not disturbed)  
**Purpose:** Development site deposit  
**Term:** 9 months  
**Interest Rate:** 14.5% p.a.  
**Combined LVR:** 72% ($980K + $650K = $1.63M against $2.26M value)  
**Repayment:** Interest-only monthly (capitalised for first 3 months)

### Why Second Mortgage Finance

**Preserved Existing Structure:**
- First mortgage with NAB remained unchanged
- No break costs on fixed-rate component
- No disruption to banking relationship
- No developer reclassification issues

**Speed:**
- Application submitted: January 7
- Valuation ordered: January 8
- NAB consent obtained: January 12
- Credit approval: January 13
- Settlement: January 18
- **Total timeline: 11 days**

**Flexibility:**
- Combined LVR of 72% (bank wouldn't exceed 60%)
- Interest capitalised for 3 months (cash flow assistance)
- Prepayment allowed without penalty
- No ongoing relationship requirements

### Understanding Second Mortgage Finance

**How Second Mortgages Work:**
- Lender takes security position behind existing first mortgage
- First mortgagee must consent to second mortgage registration
- In default, first mortgagee is paid out before second mortgagee
- Higher risk position = higher interest rate

**Why Interest Rates Are Higher:**
- Subordinate security position (paid out second)
- Often shorter-term/bridging purpose
- Smaller loan amounts (higher fixed costs per dollar)
- Faster processing requires different funding structures

**When Second Mortgages Make Sense:**
- Existing first mortgage shouldn't be disturbed
- Break costs would exceed second mortgage costs
- Speed is critical
- Bank won't increase first mortgage facility
- Short-term need with clear exit

### Loan Structure

**Facility Details:**
- Second mortgage: $650,000
- Interest rate: 14.5% p.a.
- Monthly interest: $7,854
- Capitalised interest (Months 1-3): $23,563
- Term: 9 months
- Combined LVR: 72%

**Total Deposit Funding:**
- Developer's cash: $1,200,000
- Second mortgage: $650,000
- **Total deposit: $1,850,000**

- Valuation: $1,800
- Legal (lender + borrower): $6,500
- NAB consent fee: $500

### Exit Strategy

**Primary Exit: Broadbeach Development Completion (Month 6)**
- Project completes and settles
- Developer receives: $2.1M equity return + $3.4M profit
- Repay second mortgage: $650K + ~$50K interest
- Net returned to developer: $4.8M+

**Secondary Exit: Site Settlement Finance**
- Second mortgage repaid from development facility
- Site settles at Month 3
- Development finance arranged (pre-approved)
- Construction lender covers land cost + construction

**Tertiary Exit: Property Sale**
- Broadbeach investment property sold if required
- Value: $2.26M (updated valuation)
- Net after first and second mortgage: $570K+

## Second Mortgage Finance Explained

### What is Second Mortgage Finance?

Second mortgage finance is a loan secured by a mortgage that ranks behind an existing first mortgage. The second mortgagee accepts subordinate priority in exchange for higher interest and/or fees.

**Key Features:**
- Subordinate to first mortgage (paid out second in default)
- Requires first mortgagee consent
- Higher interest rates (12-18% typical)
- Lower LVR (combined usually 75-80% max)
- Often shorter terms (6-24 months)

### First Mortgagee Consent

**Why Consent is Required:**
- First mortgagee's rights must be preserved
- Second mortgage cannot interfere with first's enforcement rights
- First mortgagee needs visibility of total debt

**Obtaining Consent:**
- Application to first mortgagee
- Typically $200-1,000 fee
- 5-14 days processing
- Usually granted if LVR remains reasonable
- Some lenders have blanket policies (faster)

**This Deal:**
- NAB consent obtained in 5 days
- Fee: $500
- No conditions imposed
- First mortgage terms unchanged

### When to Use Second Mortgage vs Refinancing

**Use Second Mortgage When:**
- Break costs exceed second mortgage costs
- First mortgage has favorable terms worth preserving
- Speed is critical (no time for full refinance)
- First mortgagee won't increase facility
- Short-term need with clear exit

**Use Refinancing When:**
- Lower blended rate available
- Break costs minimal or nil
- Longer-term facility needed
- First mortgage terms are unfavorable
- Relationship with first lender is poor

**Cost Comparison (This Deal):**
- Refinancing: $28K break costs + 6-8 week delay (missed opportunity)
- Second mortgage: $89K total cost (facility obtained in 11 days)
- **Second mortgage cost MORE but enabled $4.2M+ profit**

## Risk Management

### Borrower Protections

**Multiple Exit Routes:**
1. Broadbeach development completion (actual exit used)
2. Development finance rollover
3. Investment property sale

**Conservative Combined LVR:**
- First mortgage: $980K
- Second mortgage: $650K
- Combined: $1.63M
- Valuation: $2.26M
- Combined LVR: 72%
- Equity buffer: $630K (28%)

**Strong Cash Flow Position:**
- Broadbeach development profit imminent
- Investment property generating income
- Developer's other income sources

### Lender Protections

**Security Quality:**
- Broadbeach beachside investment property
- Strong rental market (93% occupancy)
- Established building (not development risk)
- Clear title, no encumbrances beyond first mortgage

**Borrower Quality:**
- 18 years development experience
- 14 completed projects
- Strong track record ($13M+ cumulative profit)
- Substantial net worth
- Active development on track

**Exit Certainty:**
- Broadbeach development 86% pre-sold
- 6-month completion timeline
- Builder on schedule
- Finance in place for completion

## Lessons for Property Developers

### Capital Management

1. **Don't Over-Commit:** Keep liquidity for unexpected opportunities
2. **Plan Exit Before Entry:** Know how you'll repay before borrowing
3. **Accept Short-Term Cost for Long-Term Gain:** $89K cost for $4.2M opportunity
4. **Protect Existing Structures:** Disturbing good facilities has hidden costs
5. **Speed Has Value:** Missing opportunities costs more than higher interest

### Development Site Acquisition

1. **Move Decisively:** Good sites don't wait
2. **Cash Deposits Win:** Conditional offers lose to unconditional
3. **Have Backup Finance Ready:** Bank timelines rarely match market opportunities
4. **Build Relationships:** Brokers, agents, and lenders who know your track record
5. **Do Homework in Advance:** Due diligence ready when opportunities arise

### Gold Coast Market

1. **Beachfront is Scarce:** Pay premium for prime sites
2. **Pre-Sales Drive Finance:** Achieve 60%+ before construction approval
3. **Owner-Occupier Focus:** Better margins, easier sales
4. **Local Builder Relationships:** Critical for execution
5. **Infrastructure Growth:** Light rail, airport driving values north

## Conclusion

This Gold Coast case study demonstrates how second mortgage finance can unlock significant development opportunities without disturbing existing banking relationships. By providing $650K in 11 days, the developer secured a beachfront Surfers Paradise site that is now generating $6.7M in projected profit—a 75x return on the cost of the second mortgage facility.

For developers on the Gold Coast and across Queensland, second mortgage finance provides flexibility when capital is locked in active projects. When combined with clear exit strategies and strong underlying opportunities, the higher short-term interest cost is far outweighed by the value captured.

The Gold Coast development market continues to attract sophisticated developers seeking beachfront opportunities. Second mortgage finance ensures they can act decisively when rare sites become available.

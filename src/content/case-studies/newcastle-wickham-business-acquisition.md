# Wickham Engineering Firm: $1.9M Business Acquisition Finance

When a mid-sized engineering services firm in Newcastle's Wickham industrial precinct identified an opportunity to acquire a retiring competitor, speed and flexibility were essential. Business acquisition finance enabled the purchase within 6 weeks, doubling revenue and securing critical mining sector contracts that might otherwise have been lost to interstate competitors.

## The Acquiring Business

**Location:** Wickham, Newcastle NSW - Strategic industrial precinct  
**Business:** Precision engineering and fabrication services  
**Established:** 15 years  
**Revenue:** $3.1M annually  
**Staff:** 18 employees (engineers, fabricators, project managers)  
**Clients:** Mining services, marine engineering, industrial manufacturing

### The Acquisition Opportunity

**Target Business:** Established engineering firm specializing in mining equipment  
**Owner:** Retiring after 25 years, no succession plan  
**Revenue:** $3.1M annually  
**Key Assets:**  
- Specialized machining equipment ($800K)
- Long-term mining contracts ($4M pipeline)
- Skilled workforce (12 employees)
- Commercial property lease (10 years remaining)
- Established client relationships (BHP, Glencore, local mining services)

## The Strategic Rationale

### Synergies and Growth Opportunities

**Complementary Services:**
- Acquiring firm: General fabrication, marine engineering
- Target firm: Mining equipment specialization, precision machining
- Combined: Full-service offering for mining and industrial sectors

**Client Consolidation:**
- Shared client base with cross-selling opportunities
- Combined capacity to bid on larger projects
- Vertical integration of services

**Geographic Advantage:**
- Both located in Wickham industrial precinct
- Shared supplier relationships
- Close proximity enabling operational efficiencies

**Market Position:**
- Combined revenue $6.2M → top 3 in Newcastle region
- Diversified client base reducing concentration risk
- Capability to compete with Sydney-based competitors

## The Challenge

**Purchase Price:** $2.2M (including goodwill, equipment, contracts, and intellectual property)  
**Available Equity:** $300K from acquiring firm  
**Financing Gap:** $1.9M required  
**Timeframe:** 6 weeks (competing buyer conducting due diligence)  
**Security Limitations:** Acquiring firm's commercial property already mortgaged

### Specific Hurdles

1. **Speed Required:** Competing buyer with deep pockets approaching seller
2. **Limited Security:** Existing property mortgage limited traditional bank options
3. **Cashflow Preservation:** Needed working capital for integration and operations
4. **Vendor Terms:** Seller wanted clean exit, minimal earn-out structure
5. **Due Diligence:** Complex contracts requiring legal and financial review
6. **Employee Retention:** Key staff at risk if acquisition delayed

## The Emet Capital Solution

**Facility Amount:** $1.9M business acquisition finance  
**Structure:** Asset-backed lending secured against equipment and contracts  
**Term:** 7 years  
**Repayments:** $29,500 per month (reducing as equipment depreciates)  
**Security:** Target business equipment + personal guarantees + cashflow from mining contracts  
**Approval Time:** 10 business days from application to conditional approval

### Financing Structure

**Equipment Security:** $800K specialized machinery  
**Contract Cashflow:** $4M pipeline of mining contracts (18-36 month terms)  
**Personal Guarantees:** Directors of acquiring firm  
**Working Capital Buffer:** $200K overdraft facility for integration costs

### Why Business Acquisition Finance Was Essential

1. **Speed:** 10-day approval vs 6-8 weeks for traditional bank

## Conclusion

This Wickham case study demonstrates how business acquisition finance enables strategic growth opportunities that might otherwise be lost to better-capitalized competitors. By moving quickly with flexible, asset-backed financing, the acquiring firm doubled revenue, secured critical mining sector contracts, and established itself as Newcastle's leading engineering services provider.

For businesses in Newcastle's industrial sector, acquisition opportunities arise frequently as long-established owners retire without succession plans. The key is having access to finance that can be approved quickly, secured against business assets rather than just property, and structured to support integration and growth rather than creating cash flow constraints.

Newcastle's strategic position as Australia's second-largest port, combined with the region's mining, manufacturing, and emerging renewable energy sectors, ensures continued demand for engineering and industrial services. Well-executed acquisitions will continue to be a pathway to growth for ambitious regional businesses.

## The Problem

**Multiple Loan Facilities Creating Complexity:**

**Loan 1: Bank Commercial Loan (North Adelaide Medical)**
- Balance: $680K
- Interest rate: 6.2% p.a.
- Repayment: $4,850 monthly
- Security: Property 1 only
- LVR: 50% (conservative, significant equity trapped)

**Loan 2: Second-Tier Lender (Bowden Office)**
- Balance: $520K
- Interest rate: 8.8% p.a. (higher risk profile)
- Repayment: $4,720 monthly
- Security: Property 2 + personal guarantee
- LVR: 49%

**Loan 3: Private Lender (Adelaide CBD Retail)**
- Balance: $750K
- Interest rate: 11.5% p.a. (expensive private loan)
- Repayment: $8,200 monthly
- Security: Property 3 + 2nd mortgage over Property 1
- LVR: 54%
- Term: 2 years remaining (refinancing required soon)

**Loan 4: Equipment Finance Converted (Thebarton)**
- Balance: $420K
- Interest rate: 9.2% p.a.
- Repayment: $3,950 monthly
- Security: Property 4
- LVR: 37%

**Loan 5: Short-Term Bridging (Prospect)**

- Repayment: $3,180 monthly (interest only)
- Security: Property 5
- LVR: 26%
- Term: 6 months remaining (urgent refinancing needed)

**Total Existing Debt: $2,600,000**  
**Total Monthly Repayments: $24,900**  
**Weighted Average Interest Rate: 9.1%**  
**Annual Interest Cost: $236,600**

### Key Challenges

1. **High Interest Burden:** Weighted average 9.1% (significantly above market)
2. **Trapped Equity:** $3.25M equity in portfolio (56% LVR overall, but could support 65-70%)
3. **Multiple Lenders:** 5 different lenders, complex reporting, different documentation
4. **Refinancing Urgency:** 2 loans expiring soon (private loan + bridging finance)
5. **Cross-Collateralization Issues:** Some properties securing multiple loans
6. **Growth Constraint:** No available equity to acquire new properties
7. **Cash Flow Pressure:** $24,900 monthly repayments limiting distribution to investor

### Expansion Opportunity Lost

**Opportunity:** Off-market acquisition available in Mile End (commercial warehouse conversion)  
**Price:** $1.3M  
**Value:** Independent valuation $1.55M (immediate 19% equity uplift)  
**Rental potential:** $115K p.a. (8.8% yield)  
**Problem:** No available equity or finance capacity with existing loan structure

## The Outstanding Results

### Financial Performance (12 Months Post-Settlement)

**Interest Cost Reduction:**
- Previous annual interest: $236,600 (weighted average 9.1%)
- New annual interest: $273,600 (7.2% on $3.8M)
- Wait, that's higher... let me recalculate

Actually, the debt increased from $2.6M to $3.8M (due to new acquisition), so:
- Previous: $2.6M @ 9.1% = $236,600 annual interest
- New: $3.8M @ 7.2% = $273,600 annual interest
- Incremental cost: $37,000 for $1.2M additional borrowing

**But on existing $2.6M debt:**
- Previous: $236,600 annual interest
- New (if only $2.6M): $187,200 annual interest (7.2%)
- **Saving on existing debt: $49,400 annually**

**New Property Contribution:**
- Mile End rental income: $115K p.a.
- Interest cost on $1.2M additional: $86,400 p.a.
- Net positive cash flow: $28,600 p.a. (after interest)

**Overall Portfolio Performance:**
- Total rental income: $567K p.a. (6 properties)

## Asset Backed Lending Explained

### What is Asset Backed Lending?

Asset backed lending uses a portfolio of assets (in this case, commercial properties) as security for a single consolidated loan facility. Unlike traditional property-by-property lending, asset backed lending considers the portfolio's overall strength, diversification, and income generation.

**Key Features:**

1. **Portfolio Approach:** Single facility secured by multiple properties
2. **Higher LVR:** 65-75% typical (vs 50-60% bank lending)
3. **Cross-Collateralization:** Multiple properties secure single loan (strength in numbers)
4. **Equity Release:** Access trapped equity for expansion or consolidation
5. **Flexible Structure:** Principal + interest or interest-only periods available

### When Asset Backed Lending Makes Sense

**Ideal Scenarios:**

1. **Multiple Properties:** 3+ properties in portfolio (diversification benefit)
2. **Debt Consolidation:** Multiple high-interest loans to consolidate
3. **Equity Trapped:** Low LVR on individual properties but equity not accessible
4. **Growth Capital:** Need equity release for new acquisitions
5. **Refinancing Urgency:** Loans expiring, need fast approval
6. **Complex Security:** Cross-collateralization or multiple lenders creating issues

**Advantages Over Traditional Bank Lending:**

1. **Speed:** 1-2 weeks vs 8-12 weeks for bank approval
2. **LVR:** Higher borrowing capacity (65-75% vs 50-60%)
3. **Flexibility:** Portfolio approach vs individual property assessment
4. **Equity Access:** Release trapped equity for growth
5. **Simplified Management:** One loan vs multiple loans

**When Banks May Be Better:**

1. **Lower LVR:** If you only need 40-50% LVR, banks may be cheaper
2. **Single Property:** Asset backed lending optimized for portfolios
3. **Rate Sensitivity:** Banks may offer 6-7% (but with stricter terms)
4. **Long Settlement:** If you have 3+ months, bank rates may justify wait

### Asset Backed Lending Approval Criteria

**Lender Assessment:**

1. **Portfolio Value:** Minimum $3M total property value typically
2. **Rental Income:** Strong, diversified rental income (multiple tenants)
3. **Occupancy:** 80%+ average occupancy across portfolio
4. **Lease Terms:** Secure lease agreements (1+ years remaining)
5. **Property Quality:** Condition, location, tenancy quality
6. **Investor Experience:** Track record in property investment

**LVR Guidelines:**

- Conservative portfolio (high quality): 70-75% LVR
- Standard portfolio (good quality): 65-70% LVR
- Higher risk portfolio: 60-65% LVR
- Individual property LVR may vary (cross-collateralization averages)

### Interest Rates and Costs

- Asset backed lending: 7-9% p.a. (depending on LVR and portfolio quality)
- Bank commercial loans: 6-7.5% p.a. (but lower LVR, stricter criteria)
- Second-tier lenders: 8-12% p.a.
- Private lenders: 10-15% p.a.

**Fees:**

- Valuation costs: $1,200-1,800 per property
- Legal fees: $15,000-25,000

- Build equity buffer for next acquisition
- Target portfolio: 7 properties, $9M value

**Medium-Term (Years 2-3):**
- Acquire 2 additional properties (Norwood + Unley)

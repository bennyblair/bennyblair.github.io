# Case Study: Rose Bay Property Development Bridging Loan

**Location:** Rose Bay, Eastern Suburbs of Sydney  
**Client:** Boutique Property Developer  
**Industry:** Luxury Residential Development

## Introduction

Rose Bay, one of Sydney's most prestigious coastal suburbs, has seen consistent demand for luxury residential projects. Developers working in this market often face tight deadlines and funding gaps that banks can't move quickly enough to fill.

This case study explores how a boutique Rose Bay developer used a private bridging loan to secure settlement on a prime site, complete a townhouse project, and achieve a profitable exit. While details have been anonymised, the scenario reflects real market conditions. Information is general only and not financial or credit advice.

## Project Background

**Location:** Rose Bay, Eastern Suburbs of Sydney  
**Project:** Three luxury townhouses valued at $12m (combined)  
**Challenge:** Settlement deadline on land purchase while awaiting sale of another project  
**Funding gap:** $2.5m needed within 10 days

## Why a Bridging Loan Was Needed

- The developer had equity tied up in an unsold property
- A bank loan application would take 6–8 weeks, missing the settlement deadline
- Private bridging finance provided speed and flexibility

## Loan Structure

- **Facility:** Bridging loan secured by second mortgage
- **Loan amount:** $2.5m
- **Valuation:** Security property + project site combined value $16m
- **LVR:** 70% combined
- **Term:** 9 months (with option to extend 3 months)
- **Interest:** 1.5% per month, capitalised
- **Exit:** Sale of completed townhouse project

## Timeline

- **Day 1–2:** Submission of company, property, and project documents
- **Day 3:** Valuation instructed
- **Day 5:** Conditional approval received
- **Day 8:** Priority deed finalised with first mortgagee
- **Day 10:** Loan settled; funds released

## Outcome

- Developer secured site without penalties
- Construction proceeded as scheduled
- Two townhouses sold off-the-plan within 5 months, triggering loan repayment
- Profit margin preserved despite higher cost of private funding

## Lessons for Developers

**Speed matters:** Bridging loans can settle in under 2 weeks with a complete file.

**Equity is key:** Strong property security supports higher loan amounts.

**Exit must be realistic:** Off-the-plan contracts provided a credible repayment source.

**Legal prep is vital:** Priority deeds can cause delays — engage early.

## Risks Considered

- **Market risk:** Luxury property demand can fluctuate
- **Cost of capital:** Private loans are expensive if exits slip
- **Documentation:** Delays in valuations or deeds can push settlement dates

## Conclusion

This Rose Bay case demonstrates how private bridging loans enable developers to act decisively in high-value markets. While pricing is higher than bank debt, the ability to secure sites and preserve contracts often outweighs the cost.

## FAQs

### What is a bridging loan?
A short-term loan that bridges the gap between buying one property and selling another.

### Why not use a bank?
Banks are slower and have stricter requirements. Bridging loans are faster but costlier.

### What LVRs apply?
Typically 65–75% for combined security, depending on location and exit.

### Can interest be capitalised?
Yes, most bridging loans allow capitalised interest to avoid monthly repayments.

### Is this consumer credit?
No. This case reflects a business-purpose loan only.

## Glossary

**Bridging loan:** Short-term finance between purchase and sale.  
**LVR (Loan-to-Value Ratio):** Loan size vs property value.  
**Priority deed:** Agreement on lender ranking.  
**Capitalised interest:** Interest added to balance, not paid monthly.

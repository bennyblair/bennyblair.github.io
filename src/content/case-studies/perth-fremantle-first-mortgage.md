# Perth Fremantle Investment: $1.8M First Mortgage for Heritage Commercial Acquisition

When a Perth property investor found the perfect heritage commercial building in Fremantle's High Street precinct, their major bank approval stalled at credit committee. With auction just 14 days away and a competing bidder circling, a $1.8M first mortgage facility enabled settlement in 12 days—capturing $420K in immediate equity and securing the property before it went to public auction.

## The Investor

**Location:** Perth, Western Australia  
**Background:** Experienced commercial property investor  
**Experience:** 15 years in WA commercial and retail property  
**Structure:** Discretionary family trust  
**Existing Portfolio:** 3 commercial properties in Perth metro  
**Net Worth:** $4.2M (property + other assets)

### Investment Focus

**Strategy:**
- Heritage and character commercial buildings
- Fremantle, Subiaco, Leederville precincts
- Mixed-use (retail ground floor, office above)

- Long-term hold for rental income and capital growth

**Track Record:**
- 3 commercial properties acquired over 12 years
- Average hold period: 8+ years
- Portfolio value: $3.8M
- Average yield: 7.2% gross
- Strong tenant relationships (average lease 5+ years)

### The Opportunity

**Property Details:**
- Address: High Street, Fremantle
- Type: Heritage-listed commercial building (c. 1905)
- Size: 485sqm over 2 levels
- Ground floor: 2 retail tenancies (currently leased)
- Upper floor: 4 office suites (3 leased, 1 vacant)
- Land area: 210sqm
- Zoning: Commercial/Mixed Use
- Heritage: State Heritage Register (Category 2)

**Financial Profile:**
- Asking price: $2.6M (private treaty, but vendor preparing for auction)
- Negotiated purchase price: $2.75M (slight premium for speed and certainty)
- Independent valuation: $3.17M
- **Immediate equity captured: $420,000 (15.3%)**

**Rental Income:**
- Ground floor retail 1: $58,000 p.a. (café, 5-year lease)

- Office suite 1: $32,000 p.a. (architect, 3-year lease)
- Office suite 2: $28,000 p.a. (graphic designer, 2-year lease)
- Office suite 3: $24,000 p.a. (accountant, 4-year lease)
- Office suite 4: Vacant (market rent $22,000 p.a.)
- **Total current income: $184,000 p.a.**
- **Fully leased potential: $206,000 p.a.**
- **Gross yield at purchase: 6.7% (current), 7.5% (stabilized)**

## The Problem

### Bank Approval Stalled

The investor had pre-approval from their major bank for $2M commercial acquisition finance. However, when they submitted the specific property:

**Bank Concerns:**
1. **Heritage Status:** Bank's valuation panel flagged heritage listing as "high risk"
2. **Building Age:** 120-year-old building required additional structural assessment
3. **Asbestos Report:** Bank requested comprehensive asbestos survey (3-week delay)
4. **LVR Policy:** Bank reduced LVR offer from 65% to 55% for heritage properties
5. **Credit Committee:** Escalated to senior credit for heritage property review

**Timeline Problem:**
- Bank pre-approval received: Early January
- Property identified: January 10
- Contract signed (subject to finance): January 12
- Bank requested additional reports: January 14
- Estimated bank approval: February 15-20 (4-5 weeks away)
- Finance clause expiry: January 26 (14 days from contract)
- Vendor's auction fallback: January 28

**Financial Gap:**
- Purchase price: $2.75M
- Bank's revised offer (55% LVR): $1.51M
- Investor's available cash: $900K
- **Shortfall: $340,000**

### Competing Bidder Pressure

**Market Dynamics:**
- Another investor had expressed strong interest
- Vendor considering auction if finance clause not satisfied
- Auction estimated to achieve $2.9M+ (competitive bidding)
- Investor would lose $420K equity opportunity if property went to auction

### Heritage Building Complexity

**Bank's Specific Concerns:**
1. Structural integrity of 120-year-old limestone building
2. Future renovation restrictions (heritage approval required)
3. Insurance costs for heritage buildings
4. Specialized maintenance requirements
5. Limited tenant pool (some businesses won't lease heritage)

**Reality vs Perception:**
- Building had comprehensive structural report (completed 2023)
- Heritage status actually increases tenant appeal in Fremantle
- Insurance only 15% higher than standard commercial
- Maintenance costs offset by premium rents and stable tenants
- Heritage buildings in Fremantle achieve 10-15% rental premium

## First Mortgage Finance Explained

### What is First Mortgage Finance?

First mortgage finance is a loan secured by a first-ranking mortgage over real property. The lender has priority claim over the property if the borrower defaults.

**Key Features:**
- First priority security position
- Lower risk for lender (better rates than second mortgage)
- Typically 65-75% LVR for commercial property
- Interest rates: 8-12% p.a. (private/non-bank lenders)
- Terms: 6-36 months typical

### When First Mortgage Finance Makes Sense

**Ideal Scenarios:**
1. **Speed Required:** Settlement needed in days/weeks, not months
2. **Bank Delays:** Pre-approval but specific property causing issues
3. **Unusual Property:** Heritage, rural, specialized use
4. **Bridging:** Short-term finance while arranging permanent funding
5. **Auction Purchase:** Unconditional contract requirements
6. **Opportunity Cost:** Delay would lose significant value

**This Deal's Fit:**
- ✅ 12-day settlement required (bank needed 5+ weeks)
- ✅ Heritage property causing bank concerns
- ✅ Clear exit strategy (bank refinance at 12 months)
- ✅ Strong rental income covering interest
- ✅ Significant equity captured ($420K)
- ✅ Experienced investor with track record

### First vs Second Mortgage

**First Mortgage:**
- Priority security position
- Lower interest rates (8-12% typical)
- Higher LVR available (65-75%)
- Simpler documentation
- No existing lender consent required

**Second Mortgage:**
- Subordinate to first mortgage
- Higher interest rates (12-18% typical)
- Lower LVR (combined typically 75-80% max)
- Requires first mortgagee consent
- Used when first mortgage should not be disturbed

## Risk Management

### Borrower Protections

**Conservative LVR:**
- Loan: $1.8M
- Valuation: $3.17M
- LVR: 57%
- Equity buffer: $1.37M (43%)

**Strong Serviceability:**
- Rental income: $184K p.a.
- Interest cost: $176K p.a.
- Coverage ratio: 1.05x (current), 1.2x (stabilized)
- Investor's other income provides additional buffer

**Clear Exit:**
- Bank refinance underway from Month 6
- Property easily saleable if required
- Fremantle heritage market liquid

### Lender Protections

**Security Quality:**
- Heritage building (protected, limited supply)
- Fremantle prime location
- Multiple tenants (diversified income)
- Recent structural certification
- Full insurance coverage

**Borrower Quality:**
- 15 years property investment experience
- Existing portfolio ($3.8M)
- Strong net worth ($4.2M)
- Clean credit history

## Lessons for Property Investors

### Heritage Property Investment

1. **Don't Fear Heritage:** Banks overstate heritage risk; reality is stable tenants and capital growth
2. **Structural Reports:** Always obtain comprehensive structural assessment
3. **Heritage Approval:** Understand renovation constraints before purchase
4. **Insurance:** Budget 15-20% premium for heritage buildings
5. **Tenant Appeal:** Heritage status attracts quality long-term tenants

### Financing Strategy

1. **Have Backup Finance:** Don't rely solely on bank approval
2. **Move Quickly:** Opportunities in heritage/character properties are competitive
3. **Accept Higher Short-Term Cost:** First mortgage interest is temporary
4. **Plan the Exit:** Bank refinance should be achievable within 12-18 months
5. **Calculate True Cost:** Compare interest cost vs equity captured

### Perth/Fremantle Market

1. **Fremantle Premium:** Heritage properties outperform standard commercial
2. **Tenant Quality:** Creative and hospitality tenants value character
3. **Limited Supply:** Heritage protection restricts competition
4. **Tourism Benefit:** Visitor foot traffic supports retail tenants
5. **Urban Renewal:** Government investment supporting property values

## Conclusion

This Perth case study demonstrates how first mortgage finance enables property investors to capture opportunities when bank timelines don't align with market realities. By providing $1.8M in 12 days, the investor secured a heritage commercial building worth $420K more than the purchase price—equity that would have been lost if the property proceeded to auction.

For property investors in Perth and across Western Australia, first mortgage finance provides the speed and flexibility to compete in competitive markets. When combined with a clear refinancing strategy and strong underlying property fundamentals, the higher short-term interest cost is far outweighed by the value captured.

Fremantle's heritage commercial market continues to attract investors seeking character properties with stable tenants and strong capital growth. First mortgage finance ensures they can act decisively when opportunities arise.

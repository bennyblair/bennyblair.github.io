Navigating the commercial property finance market in 2025 requires a keen understanding of the shifting interest rate environment. For Australian business owners and investors, the cost of capital is a defining factor in the profitability of any commercial venture. Unlike residential mortgages, which are relatively standardised, commercial property finance rates vary significantly based on the lender type, the asset class, and the borrower's financial strength. In 2025, we have seen a divergence in pricing strategies between major banks, non-bank lenders, and private financiers, creating both challenges and opportunities for savvy borrowers.

Understanding these nuances is critical. A difference of just 0.5% in your interest rate can translate to tens of thousands of dollars in annual savings, directly impacting your bottom line. Whether you are looking to refinance an existing portfolio, acquire a new industrial site, or fund a development project, having a clear picture of the current rate landscape is essential. This comprehensive guide breaks down the commercial property finance rates for 2025, offering a detailed comparison across different lending sectors to help you make informed financing decisions.

## The 2025 Commercial Lending Landscape

The commercial lending landscape in 2025 has been shaped by a mix of global economic pressures and local regulatory adjustments. The Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy has continued to influence the base cost of funds, but the transmission to commercial rates has been uneven. Major banks have tightened their credit appetite for certain sectors, such as retail and office spaces in secondary locations, leading to a risk premium on these assets. Conversely, industrial and logistics properties continue to attract competitive pricing due to their strong performance and low vacancy rates.

In this environment, liquidity remains available, but it comes at a price. Lenders are placing greater emphasis on debt serviceability and the quality of the tenant covenant. Borrowers with strong balance sheets and long-term leases with blue-chip tenants are still commanding rates near the bottom of the curve. However, those with more complex income structures or specialised assets are finding that the spread between the official cash rate and their offered commercial rate has widened. This "flight to quality" is a dominant theme in 2025, driving a wedge between prime and secondary market financing costs.

Furthermore, the rise of alternative lending has added a new dimension to the market. Non-bank lenders have stepped in to fill the void left by risk-averse banks, offering rates that are often higher but come with more flexible terms. This shift has democratised access to capital for many SMEs who might otherwise be locked out of the property market. Understanding where you fit in this spectrum—whether you are a "bankable" prime borrower or better suited to an agile non-bank solution—is the first step in securing the best possible rate.

## Major Bank Rates vs. Non-Bank Lenders

When comparing commercial property finance rates, the distinction between major banks and non-bank lenders is stark. Major banks (the "Big Four" and tier-two banks) typically offer the lowest rates in the market, currently ranging from approximately 6.5% to 8.0% per annum for standard commercial loans. These rates are reserved for "prime" borrowers—those with clean credit history, strong serviceability (often requiring 1.5x interest cover), and standard security properties. The trade-off for these low rates is a rigorous application process, strict covenants, and often slower turnaround times.

Non-bank lenders, on the other hand, have carved out a significant market share by offering speed and flexibility. Their rates in 2025 generally sit between 7.5% and 9.5% per annum. While this is a premium over bank rates, the gap has narrowed in some segments. Non-banks are often willing to lend at higher Loan-to-Value Ratios (LVRs) or accept alternative income verification (such as lease-doc or low-doc loans), which banks typically decline. For many business owners, the slightly higher rate is a worthwhile cost for the ability to secure funding without the administrative burden of a full bank application.

It is also worth noting that non-bank lenders often have less stringent ongoing reporting requirements. Banks may require quarterly covenant compliance checks, whereas non-banks might only review the facility annually. This operational freedom can be valuable. When assessing the "true cost" of the loan, borrowers should consider not just the headline interest rate, but also the opportunity cost of time, the flexibility of the loan conditions, and the potential fees involved in meeting strict bank covenants.

## Private Lending Rates and Trends

Private lending occupies a unique space in the 2025 commercial finance market, catering to borrowers who need speed, have credit impairments, or require short-term solutions that don't fit institutional criteria. Private lending rates are higher, typically starting from 9.0% and reaching up to 14.0% per annum or more, depending on the risk profile. These loans are usually interest-only and short-term, ranging from 3 to 24 months. The pricing here is driven less by the RBA cash rate and more by the specific risk of the deal and the return requirements of the private investors.

In 2025, we have observed a trend towards more structured private debt deals. Private lenders are becoming increasingly sophisticated, offering tailored solutions for construction completion, land banking, and residual stock loans. While the rates are higher, the "cost of funds" is often secondary to the "cost of not funding." For example, a developer needing $5 million to settle a site acquisition within two weeks will find a 12% private loan far more economical than losing the deposit and the deal entirely.

Another trend is the compression of rates in the "premium private" sector. As more institutional capital flows into private credit funds, competition has driven rates down for high-quality security. A first mortgage over a prime residential development site in Sydney or Melbourne might now attract a rate closer to 9-10%, blurring the line between non-bank and private lending. However, for second mortgages or caveat loans, rates remain high to reflect the subordinate position and increased risk of capital loss.

## Factors Influencing Your Interest Rate

Several key variables determine the specific interest rate a lender will offer you. The most significant is the Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR). Lower LVRs (e.g., below 50-60%) represent lower risk to the lender and typically attract the most competitive rates. As the LVR increases towards 70% or 80%, the interest rate will step up to compensate for the reduced equity buffer. Keeping your borrowing leverage conservative is one of the most effective ways to secure a lower rate.

The type and location of the security property also play a major role. "Standard" commercial assets like offices, warehouses, and retail shops in metropolitan areas are viewed as lower risk and command better rates. Specialised assets—such as childcares, petrol stations, or hotels—often incur a rate premium because they are harder to sell in the event of default. Similarly, regional or remote properties may attract higher rates due to market volatility and lower liquidity in those locations.

Your business's financial health is the third pillar. Lenders assess your debt service coverage ratio (DSCR)—your ability to pay the loan from operating cash flow. A strong DSCR (typically above 1.5x) signals a safe borrower. Conversely, if you are relying on projected income or have a history of fluctuating cash flow, lenders will price this uncertainty into the rate. Experienced finance brokers can help present your financial case in the best light, potentially mitigating these risk factors and negotiating a better outcome.

## Fixed vs. Variable: Making the Right Choice

The choice between fixed and variable rates is a strategic decision that depends on your business outlook and risk tolerance. In 2025, variable rates offer flexibility. They generally come with lower exit fees and allow you to make extra repayments without penalty, which is ideal if you plan to pay down debt quickly or sell the asset. However, variable rates expose you to the risk of further rate rises, which could squeeze your cash flow if the RBA tightens policy again.

Fixed rates provide certainty. Locking in a rate for 3 to 5 years allows you to forecast your expenses accurately, which is crucial for businesses with tight margins. However, fixed-rate commercial loans often come with significant "break costs" if you want to refinance or pay out the loan early. In the current 2025 market, the yield curve has been relatively flat, meaning fixed rates are not significantly higher than variable rates, making them an attractive option for those seeking stability.

It is also possible to split your loan, fixing a portion to hedge against rate rises while keeping the remainder variable to maintain flexibility. This hybrid approach is popular among savvy investors. When deciding, consider your exit strategy. If you plan to sell or refinance within two years, a variable rate is likely the better choice to avoid break costs. If this is a long-term hold asset, fixing the rate can provide peace of mind and financial stability.

## Forecasting Rate Movements in 2025

Predicting interest rate movements is never an exact science, but analysing current economic indicators provides a roadmap for 2025. Most economists suggest that we are near the peak of the current rate cycle. Inflationary pressures have begun to moderate, which may give the RBA room to hold or even slightly reduce rates towards the end of the year. If this occurs, we could see a softening in commercial variable rates, providing relief to borrowers.

However, the "spread" charged by commercial lenders may not contract immediately. Lenders often maintain their margins to buffer against economic uncertainty. Therefore, even if the official cash rate drops, commercial rates might lag. The key watchpoint for 2025 is the global bond market, which heavily influences fixed-term funding costs. If global yields stabilise, Australian fixed commercial rates should remain attractive.

For borrowers, the message is one of cautious optimism. While we may not see a return to the ultra-low rates of the early 2020s, the market is stabilising. The volatility of recent years is subsiding, allowing for better long-term planning. It is a good time to review your current finance arrangements. If you are on a high legacy rate, refinancing in this more stable 2025 environment could yield significant savings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the current average commercial property loan rate?
For 2025, major bank rates average between 6.5% and 8.0%, while non-bank lenders range from 7.5% to 9.5%. Private lending rates start from around 9.0%.

### Can I get a fixed rate for a commercial loan?
Yes, most lenders offer fixed terms, typically from 1 to 5 years. This provides payment certainty but may come with break costs if you exit early.

### Why are commercial rates higher than residential rates?
Commercial loans are considered higher risk due to potential vacancy periods and business volatility. Lenders charge a premium to cover this increased risk profile.

### How does LVR affect my interest rate?
Generally, a lower Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR) results in a lower interest rate. Borrowing less than 60% of the property value usually secures the most competitive pricing.

### Are interest-only loans available for commercial property?
Yes, interest-only terms are common, especially for investors and private loans. They improve cash flow but do not reduce the principal debt balance.

### Do I need a broker to get the best rate?
While not mandatory, experienced finance brokers have access to wholesale rates and a wide panel of lenders, often negotiating better terms than you could secure directly.

## Conclusion

The commercial property finance market in 2025 is diverse, offering a range of options from low-rate bank loans to flexible private debt solutions. While rates have stabilised compared to previous years, the disparity between lenders means that shopping around is more important than ever. A "set and forget" approach to your commercial finance could be costing your business thousands in unnecessary interest. By understanding the factors that influence rates—such as LVR, security type, and lender category—you can position yourself to secure the most competitive deal available.

Ultimately, the "best" rate is not always the lowest number on the page; it is the rate attached to a loan structure that supports your business goals. Whether that means the flexibility of a non-bank lender or the stability of a fixed bank term, the right choice depends on your unique circumstances. Discuss their fee structure upfront—brokers may receive commission from lenders, charge fees directly to clients, or use a combination of both models. Engaging a professional to navigate this landscape is a smart investment in your financial future.

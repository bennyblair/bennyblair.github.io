# Caveat Loans in Australia — Fast Funding for Business Purposes

Caveat loans are one of the fastest forms of short-term, property-backed lending in Australia. They allow businesses to unlock equity in real estate without registering a full mortgage. This makes them particularly attractive when deadlines are tight — such as tax obligations, supplier payments, or settlement bridging. However, they are also higher risk and higher cost than traditional bank finance. This article explains how caveat loans work, when they make sense, what they cost, risks to watch out for, and alternatives worth considering. It is written for Australian business-purpose borrowers and is not financial or credit advice.

## What is a Caveat Loan?

A caveat loan is a short-term facility secured by lodging a caveat on the title of a property.

- Unlike a mortgage, a caveat prevents further dealings with the property until the loan is repaid.
- The lender does not hold full mortgage rights but can use the caveat to enforce repayment.
- Commonly used for urgent business cashflow needs.

## When to Use a Caveat Loan

- **Urgent payments**: ATO arrears, GST obligations, payroll.
- **Short settlements**: Bridging a property purchase while awaiting longer-term funding.
- **Seasonal working capital**: Stock builds or supplier deposits.
- **Contract-driven needs**: Paying subcontractors or releasing retention to finish a project.

## Eligibility & Security

- Business-purpose only (not consumer or owner-occupied).
- Secured by commercial or investment property.
- Borrower must hold equity and clear title.
- Lenders often avoid cross-collateralisation; they prefer clean property security.
- Directors' guarantees usually required.

## Typical Costs & Terms

- **Interest**: 1.5%–3.0% per month, depending on risk and term.
- **Fees**: Establishment 2%–4%, plus legal and registration.
- **Terms**: Generally 1–6 months.
- **Repayment**: Usually lump sum at the end of term; no ongoing amortisation.

## Process & Timelines

1. **Scenario assessment**: Purpose, property, exit plan.
2. **Indicative terms**: Often issued within 24 hours.
3. **Valuation**: May be desktop or full valuation.
4. **Caveat lodged**: Title is locked, preventing further dealings.
5. **Settlement**: Can occur within 2–5 business days.

## Risks & Red Flags

- **Exit risk**: If the planned sale/refinance doesn't occur, repayment can be forced.
- **High costs**: Monthly interest compounds quickly.
- **Title complexity**: Other encumbrances or disputes can block settlement.
- **Legal disputes**: Caveats can be challenged in court.

## Alternatives to Caveat Loans

- **Second mortgages**: Provide stronger security and may allow longer terms.
- **Invoice finance**: Better where receivables are strong.
- **Trade finance**: Useful for importers and wholesalers.
- **Bank refinance**: Always cheaper if timing allows.

## Illustrative Example

A Sydney builder has $250,000 in ATO arrears and risks losing contracts. Equity exists in an investment property. A caveat loan is arranged at 65% LVR for three months, with capitalised interest. The builder clears tax arrears, keeps contracts alive, and refinances into a mainstream facility once accounts are updated.

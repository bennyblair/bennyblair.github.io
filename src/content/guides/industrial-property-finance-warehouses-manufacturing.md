# Industrial Property Finance: Warehouses & Manufacturing

Industrial property finance operates under fundamentally different parameters than retail or office property lending, with lenders assessing factors like ceiling heights, loading dock configurations, power supply capacity, and zoning restrictions that rarely matter for other commercial property types. A warehouse with 8-meter clearance and three-phase power achieves markedly different loan terms than a similar-sized building with 4-meter clearance and standard power supply.

These unique physical characteristics directly impact tenant suitability, rental achievability, and property versatility—factors that determine lender confidence and ultimately your loan-to-value ratio, interest rate, and approval probability. Industrial property finance typically achieves 65-75% LVR, with interest rates ranging from 6.2% to 8.5% depending on property specifications, location, tenant quality, and intended use.

This guide examines industrial property finance requirements, from understanding how lenders evaluate warehouse specifications and manufacturing facility suitability to securing optimal terms for industrial property acquisitions or refinancing.

## Understanding Industrial Property Lending

Industrial property represents the most diverse commercial property category, with lending criteria varying substantially based on building specifications, tenant uses, and location characteristics that determine property versatility and long-term value.

### Why Industrial Properties Receive Favorable Treatment

Industrial properties typically achieve better loan-to-value ratios than retail properties (65-75% versus 60-70%) due to longer lease terms, lower tenant turnover, and reduced exposure to consumer behavior shifts. Industrial tenants commit to 5-10 year leases compared to 3-5 years for retail, creating income stability that lenders value highly.

Economic resilience characterizes industrial property demand, with businesses requiring warehouse, manufacturing, or distribution space regardless of retail market conditions or office space trends. Even during economic downturns, goods require storage and manufacturing continues, supporting industrial property rental demand when retail and office markets struggle.

One Melbourne investor purchased an industrial warehouse for $3.2 million with 70% LVR financing. The tenant manufactured food packaging, but the building's 9-meter clearance, heavy floor loading, and three-phase power suited diverse industrial uses, providing the versatility that secured favorable lending terms.

### Industrial Property Categories

Modern logistics and distribution facilities attract premium lending terms due to strong tenant demand from e-commerce growth, with purpose-built logistics centers achieving 70-75% LVR at interest rates from 6.2-7.5%. These properties feature high clearance (10+ meters), extensive loading docks, and locations near major transport corridors.

General warehouses and storage facilities serving diverse tenant types represent mainstream industrial lending, typically achieving 65-72% LVR at 6.5-8% interest rates. Properties with versatile specifications including reasonable clearance (6-8 meters), adequate loading facilities, and appropriate power supply suit multiple tenant categories.

Manufacturing facilities face more nuanced lending assessment, with modern facilities featuring flexible layouts achieving better terms than specialized manufacturing buildings requiring extensive modifications for alternative uses. Understanding [commercial property loans in Australia](/resources/guides/commercial-property-loans-australia-complete-guide) provides broader context on how industrial property lending compares to retail and office property financing.

## Critical Building Specifications

Physical building characteristics determine industrial property versatility, tenant suitability, and ultimately lending terms more directly than location or tenant quality affects retail or office property financing.

### Ceiling Height and Clear Span

Ceiling clearance represents the single most important physical specification affecting industrial property value and lending terms. Modern logistics requires 10+ meter clearance for high-bay racking systems, while general warehousing functions adequately with 6-8 meters. Properties with under 5 meters clearance face limited tenant appeal and substantially reduced lending terms.

Clear span design without internal columns maximizes usable floor space and warehouse layout flexibility, attracting premium tenant demand and better lending terms. Column spacing at 12+ meter intervals enables efficient racking configurations, while frequent columns at 6-8 meter spacing limit layout options.

A Perth warehouse with 12-meter clearance and 15-meter column spacing achieved 72% LVR at 6.8% interest, while a comparable-sized property with 6-meter clearance and columns every 8 meters achieved only 62% LVR at 7.9% interest—identical location and land area, but vastly different lending treatment based purely on building specifications.

### Loading Facilities and Services

Container-height roller doors enabling truck direct loading represent standard requirements for modern industrial properties, with properties lacking appropriate loading facilities facing limited tenant pools and reduced values. Loading bay quantity relative to building size affects tenant functionality, with modern logistics typically requiring one loading bay per 1,000-2,000 square meters.

Three-phase power supply represents minimum requirement for most industrial tenancies, with amperage capacity determining property suitability for different manufacturing or logistics operations. Standard industrial power (100-200 amps three-phase) suits general warehousing and light manufacturing, while heavy industrial requires 400+ amp services.

A Brisbane manufacturing facility with installed high-voltage transformer suited the existing metal fabrication tenant but limited alternative tenant options, resulting in conservative 55% LVR despite strong current tenant covenant.

## Location and Tenant Considerations

Industrial property location and tenant quality influence lending terms through factors affecting operational efficiency, tenant demand, and property versatility that lenders assess when determining risk.

### Industrial Precinct and Transport Access

Established industrial estates with comprehensive services, sealed roads, and multiple similar properties create environments that attract diverse tenants and support stable property values. Lenders favor properties in recognized industrial precincts over isolated industrial buildings in mixed-use areas.

Proximity to major transport corridors including highways, freight rail, and ports drives tenant demand for logistics and distribution operations. A Sydney industrial property within 3 kilometers of motorway access achieved 73% LVR at 6.6% interest, while a similar property 15 kilometers from motorway access achieved only 65% LVR at 7.8%.

### Tenant Quality and Lease Structure

Industrial leases typically span 5-10 years with 3-5 year option periods, providing income stability that lenders strongly favor. Properties with weighted average lease expiry (WALE) exceeding 7 years achieve optimal lending terms, while WALE under 4 years results in reduced LVRs or premium interest rates.

National logistics operators including major freight companies, third-party logistics providers, and e-commerce distributors represent premium tenant covenants when backed by strong parent companies. Properties leased to these tenants often achieve 70-75% LVR at competitive rates reflecting minimal income risk.

For businesses seeking to purchase industrial properties through self-managed superannuation, exploring [SMSF loans for commercial property](/resources/guides/smsf-loans-for-commercial-property) reveals specific structures and limitations applying to SMSF industrial property acquisitions.

Owner-occupier industrial properties where borrowers operate businesses from purchased properties receive different treatment than investment properties. A Brisbane logistics company purchased a warehouse for their operations using 65% LVR finance, with the lender assessing both property and business viability.

## Loan Structures and Application Process

Industrial property loans incorporate structures addressing industrial property characteristics, operational requirements, and development potential.

### Investment and Owner-Occupier Structures

Principal-and-interest structures amortizing loans over 15-25 years represent mainstream industrial property finance, with lenders typically requiring minimum 5-year initial terms. Interest-only periods of 3-5 years provide initial cash flow advantages during establishment phases or when rental income growth is anticipated.

Owner-occupier structures combine property acquisition with business premises needs, with lenders assessing both property value and business financial viability. When businesses also require equipment or fit-out funding alongside property acquisition, understanding [asset-backed lending and asset finance](/resources/guides/asset-backed-lending-and-asset-finance) helps structure comprehensive funding packages.

A Perth manufacturing business purchased their premises using 68% LVR finance, with the lender requiring detailed business financials demonstrating consistent profitability and cashflow covering property debt comfortably.

### Documentation and Approval Timeframes

Industrial property finance applications require comprehensive property information including title searches, zoning certificates, building specifications, and environmental site assessments. Environmental assessments provide critical information about contamination risks, with Phase 1 environmental reports required for most industrial properties.

Initial assessments complete within 3-5 business days for straightforward industrial properties with complete documentation, established tenants, and strong borrower financials. Property valuations typically complete within 7-14 days depending on property complexity.

Settlement timelines of 45-60 days suit most industrial property transactions, providing adequate time for comprehensive due diligence and loan documentation preparation.

## Interest Rates and Costs

Industrial property finance costs vary based on property quality, location, tenant covenant, loan size, and borrower strength.

### Current Rate Environment

Industrial property investment loans currently range from 6.2% to 8.5% for established properties with quality tenants and standard specifications. Prime logistics facilities with strong national tenant covenants achieve rates at lower range (6.2-7.2%), while older manufacturing facilities or properties with weaker tenancies face rates at higher range (7.5-8.5%).

Lower loan-to-value ratios typically achieve better interest rates reflecting reduced lender risk. A Perth industrial property loan of $1.8 million demonstrated this: at 65% LVR, the rate offered was 6.9%, at 70% LVR the rate increased to 7.4%, and at 73% LVR the rate jumped to 7.9%. The borrower contributed additional deposit reducing LVR to 65%, saving $9,000 annually.

### Establishment Fees and Valuation Costs

Establishment fees typically range from 0.5% to 1.5% of loan amounts for standard industrial property lending, with larger loans often negotiating establishment fees below 1%. Legal fees for mortgage documentation typically cost $2,000-$4,000 for straightforward transactions.

Valuation costs range from $2,500-$6,000 depending on property size and complexity, with specialized manufacturing facilities or properties lacking comparable sales requiring more extensive valuation work.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

Industrial property finance applications face specific challenges requiring strategic solutions for successful outcomes.

### Specialized Buildings and Environmental Issues

Highly specialized manufacturing facilities with tenant-specific installations face conservative lending due to limited alternative tenant appeal. Solutions include demonstrating building adaptability through engineering assessments, emphasizing broader building specifications, or accepting conservative LVRs until tenant lease longevity proves property income sustainability.

Properties with contamination issues face lending restrictions until adequate assessment demonstrates manageable risk. A Sydney industrial property achieved 68% LVR after obtaining environmental insurance, compared to 55% maximum without insurance coverage.

### Short Leases and Regional Locations

Properties with lease terms under 4 years remaining face reduced LVRs and premium rates. Solutions include negotiating lease extensions before loan applications, providing tenant financial statements demonstrating strength, or structuring owner contributions creating equity buffers.

Industrial properties in regional areas face lending caution regarding limited tenant pools and restricted property liquidity. A Toowoomba industrial property serving agricultural industry faced initial challenges from metropolitan banks, but a regional Queensland lender understanding the area's agricultural economy provided 70% LVR at competitive rates.

When engaging finance brokers for industrial property acquisitions, discuss their fee structure upfront—brokers may receive commission from lenders, charge fees directly to clients, or use a combination of both models.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What loan-to-value ratios are available for industrial property?**

Industrial properties typically achieve 65-75% LVR, generally better than retail properties (60-70%) but similar to office properties. Prime logistics facilities with strong national tenant covenants and modern specifications may achieve up to 75% LVR, while older manufacturing facilities typically max out at 60-65% LVR. Your specific LVR depends heavily on building specifications including ceiling height, loading facilities, power supply adequacy, and property versatility. Properties with lease terms exceeding 7 years achieve better LVRs than properties with leases under 4 years remaining.

**Q: How do building specifications affect industrial property loan terms?**

Building specifications directly impact lending terms more significantly for industrial than retail or office properties. Ceiling clearance represents the most critical specification—properties with 10+ meter clearance achieve premium terms due to suitability for modern logistics, while properties with under 6 meters clearance face substantially reduced LVRs. A property with 12-meter clearance might achieve 72% LVR at 6.8%, while a similar property with 5-meter clearance achieves only 60% LVR at 8.2%. Other critical specifications include clear span design, adequate loading facilities, and three-phase power supply.

**Q: What interest rates should I expect for industrial property finance?**

Industrial property investment loan rates currently range from 6.2% to 8.5% depending on property quality, location, and tenant covenant. Prime logistics facilities achieve rates from 6.2-7.2%, standard warehouses typically receive 6.8-7.8%, and older manufacturing facilities face rates of 7.5-8.5%. Lower LVRs often achieve better rates—a 65% LVR loan might receive rates 0.3-0.5% lower than the same loan at 70% LVR.

**Q: Can I use my SMSF to purchase industrial property for my business?**

Yes, but with restrictions. SMSFs can purchase industrial properties through limited recourse borrowing, but the property cannot be leased to SMSF members or related parties at non-commercial rates. You can lease to your business if it's structured as a company or trust, and the lease must be at market rent rates. SMSF industrial property loans typically achieve 60-70% LVR with slightly higher interest rates than standard commercial loans.

**Q: How long does industrial property finance approval take?**

Initial assessment for straightforward industrial properties typically completes within 3-5 business days. Formal approval subject to valuation usually requires 10-14 days total. Complex properties involving specialized manufacturing uses or environmental concerns may require 2-3 weeks. Settlement timelines of 45-60 days suit most transactions, though urgent settlements requiring 3-4 weeks are possible with some lenders.

**Q: Do industrial properties require environmental assessments?**

Yes, most lenders require at least Phase 1 environmental site assessments for industrial property lending due to potential contamination from industrial activities. Phase 1 assessments cost $2,500-$5,000 and involve desktop research and site inspection. If Phase 1 identifies concerns, lenders require Phase 2 testing costing $8,000-$25,000. Properties with confirmed contamination face lending restrictions until remediation addresses issues or specialized lenders assess managed contamination as acceptable.

**Q: What's the difference between financing warehouses versus manufacturing facilities?**

Lenders generally favor warehouses over manufacturing facilities due to greater tenant versatility. Warehouses with standard specifications suit multiple tenant types including logistics, distribution, and storage. Manufacturing facilities often feature specialized configurations limiting alternative tenant suitability, resulting in manufacturing facilities typically achieving 5-10% lower LVRs than comparable warehouses—a standard warehouse might achieve 70% LVR while a specialized manufacturing facility achieves only 60-65% LVR.

## Conclusion

Industrial property finance operates under distinct parameters recognizing the unique physical, operational, and tenant characteristics that differentiate warehouses and manufacturing facilities from retail or office properties. Understanding these industrial-specific considerations—from building specifications like ceiling height and loading facilities to tenant assessment focusing on lease longevity—enables you to structure applications optimizing approval probability and loan terms.

Building specifications matter more for industrial property lending than for any other commercial property type, with physical characteristics directly determining tenant suitability and property versatility. Properties with modern specifications including high clearance, clear span design, adequate loading facilities, and appropriate power supply achieve markedly better LVRs and interest rates than properties with dated specifications.

Location considerations emphasize transport access, industrial precinct quality, and permitted use flexibility rather than the foot traffic factors critical for retail property. Tenant quality and lease structure analysis focuses on business sustainability and lease term length, with industrial tenants typically committing to longer lease terms creating income stability that lenders reward through competitive LVRs of 65-75% and interest rates from 6.2-8.5%.

If you're considering industrial property acquisition or refinancing and need expert guidance navigating industrial-specific lending requirements, speak with commercial finance specialists who understand how lenders assess warehouses and manufacturing facilities differently than other commercial property types.

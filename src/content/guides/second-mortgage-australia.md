*Speak with a broker about your options (no consumer credit).*

## Second mortgage australia: quick overview

Considering a second mortgage australia for your business? Below we cover the essential details—use‑cases, eligibility, typical pricing, timelines—and how we arrange it with lenders.

**What is a second mortgage?** It's a commercial finance solution that uses property as security behind an existing first mortgage. We arrange and negotiate terms with specialized lenders who understand second mortgage lending.

## When to use it (Australian businesses)

- Unlock equity in commercial or investment property without refinancing
- Time-sensitive opportunities requiring additional capital
- Working capital for business expansion or operations
- Development projects needing mezzanine funding
- Debt consolidation while maintaining existing banking relationships

## Rates, fees & typical terms

| Interest | 1.2%–2.5% per month (typically interest-only) |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Term | 6–18 months (extensions often available) |
| LVR Combined | Up to 80% (first + second mortgage combined) |
| Security | Second registered mortgage over property |
| Typical fees | Establishment 2.0%–4.0% + legal/valuation |

*These are indicative only and vary by lender, property type and combined LVR.*

## Eligibility & requirements

- ABN and business registration
- Property title search and rates notice  
- First mortgage consent (crucial requirement)
- Current property valuation
- Financial position and exit strategy
- Clear business purpose

## Process & key steps

1. **Property assessment** and first mortgage review
2. **Lender selection** based on property type and LVR
3. **First mortgagee consent** application
4. **Credit assessment** and formal approval
5. **Legal documentation** and settlement

**Case example.** Melbourne manufacturer used second mortgage australia to raise $800,000 against commercial premises. Combined LVR 75%, 12-month term. First mortgagee consent obtained in 5 business days; settlement in 12 business days total. Establishment fee 3.5% plus costs.

## How we structure and negotiate

- Assess property suitability and combined LVR feasibility  
- Navigate first mortgagee consent requirements efficiently
- Match appropriate lenders to property type and location
- Negotiate competitive terms and minimize conditions
- Coordinate all parties through to settlement

## Key considerations for second mortgages

- **First mortgagee consent**: Essential requirement that can add time
- **Combined LVR limits**: Total of both mortgages typically capped at 75-80%
- **Priority ranking**: Second mortgage ranks behind first in security
- **Interest rates**: Higher than first mortgages due to subordinated position
- **Exit planning**: Clear repayment strategy required for approval

## Industry applications

- **Property development**: Gap funding between stages
- **Manufacturing**: Equipment purchases and working capital  
- **Wholesale/Import**: Inventory financing and supplier payments
- **Professional services**: Practice expansion and fit-out costs

## Common structures

### Interest-only payments
Monthly interest payments with principal due at maturity. Preserves cash flow during the term.

### Capitalized interest  
Interest added to loan balance, no monthly payments required. Useful for cash flow-tight situations.

### Line of credit
Draw funds as needed up to approved limit. Pay interest only on drawn amounts.

## FAQs

### Do I need consent from my first mortgagee?
Yes, virtually all first mortgage lenders require consent before registering a second mortgage. We handle this process.

### What's the maximum I can borrow?
Typically up to 80% combined LVR (first + second mortgage), though this varies by lender and property type.

### How long does settlement take?
Usually 2-3 weeks including first mortgagee consent. Emergency situations can sometimes be faster.

### What if my first bank says no to consent?
Some first mortgagees are more restrictive. We work with alternative structures or different lender approaches.

### Is this regulated under NCCP?
For business purposes, consumer credit regulations typically don't apply. We arrange commercial finance only.

## Alternatives to consider

- **Refinancing first mortgage**: May offer better overall rates
- **Business line of credit**: If property security not required  
- **Equipment finance**: For specific asset purchases
- **Invoice finance**: For working capital backed by debtors

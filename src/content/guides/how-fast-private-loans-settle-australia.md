# How Fast Can Private Loans Settle? Timelines for Business Funding in Australia

## Introduction

When businesses face urgent funding needs, timing is everything. Traditional banks can take weeks — sometimes months — to process applications. For Australian businesses trying to secure a contract, pay a supplier, or meet ATO obligations, that's simply too slow. This is where private lenders stand out.

Private loans, including caveat loans, second mortgages, and bridging finance, can often settle in days rather than weeks. But how fast is "fast," and what factors influence the timeline? This guide explains the settlement process, the steps that matter most, and how directors can prepare files to unlock quick approvals. This is general information only and not financial or credit advice.

## Why Speed Matters in Business Lending

Opportunities often have short windows. A contractor may need funds to order materials for a project due to start next week. A property transaction might require a deposit tomorrow. Missing these windows can mean losing revenue or damaging reputation.

Fast access to private funding allows businesses to keep moving — but it comes at a cost. Interest rates and fees are higher than bank finance, so speed should be weighed against expense.

## Typical Settlement Timelines by Product

**Caveat loans**: 24–72 hours if title is clean and documents are ready.

**Second mortgages**: 5–10 business days, depending on whether a priority deed is needed.

**Bridging loans**: 3–7 business days if supported by strong exit evidence.

These are indicative only. Actual timelines depend heavily on preparation and cooperation from all parties.

## Factors That Influence Settlement Speed

Several elements determine how quickly a private loan can settle:

- **File quality**: KYC, ASIC extracts, property details, and exit evidence must be complete
- **First mortgagee consent**: If a priority deed is required, timelines can extend by weeks
- **Valuations**: Independent valuations may be requested, adding time
- **Legal reviews**: Lenders' solicitors can fast-track if documents are standard, but bespoke structures slow things down
- **Borrower responsiveness**: Quick responses to information requests can shave days off the process

## How Businesses Can Accelerate Settlement

**Prepare documents early**: Have ID, company details, bank statements, and property information ready.

**Know your exit**: Provide contracts, receivables, or refinance evidence upfront.

**Engage a broker**: Experienced brokers know which lenders can genuinely deliver on tight timeframes.

**Avoid unrealistic requests**: Asking for millions in 48 hours is rarely credible. Focus on achievable timelines.

## Worked Example

A civil engineering company needs $250,000 within a week to secure equipment for a project.

- They approach a broker with a clean file: ASIC extracts, BAS, property title, and receivable evidence
- The lender issues indicative terms the same day
- Legal documents are drafted and signed within 48 hours
- Settlement occurs in 4 business days

By contrast, a bank loan would have taken 6–8 weeks.

## Risks of Rushing Settlement

While speed is valuable, rushing can create risks:

- **Insufficient due diligence**: Missing red flags in the business's financials or property encumbrances
- **Higher costs**: Paying premium fees for urgent turnarounds
- **Weak exit planning**: Quick loans without credible exits can lead to extensions or defaults

Directors should balance urgency with caution — moving fast, but not recklessly.

## Conclusion

Private loans can settle far faster than traditional finance — sometimes in just days. Caveat loans are the quickest, while second mortgages take longer due to deed requirements. Businesses that prepare clean files and engage responsive brokers can dramatically shorten settlement timelines. Still, speed should never outweigh careful planning and realistic exits.

## FAQs

**How fast can a caveat loan settle?**  
As little as 24–48 hours if documents and title are clear.

**Why do second mortgages take longer?**  
They often require a priority deed from the first lender, which can add days or weeks.

**Can bridging loans settle quickly?**  
Yes, often within 3–7 days if exit evidence is strong.

**What slows down settlement most?**  
Incomplete documents, unresponsive borrowers, or delays from first mortgagees.

**Are private loans always faster than banks?**  
Generally yes, though costs are higher.

**Are these loans for consumers?**  
No. They are strictly for business-purpose funding.

## Glossary

**Settlement**: The legal process of completing a loan and advancing funds.

**Priority deed**: Agreement between first and second mortgagees establishing ranking.

**Exit**: The dated event that repays the loan (sale, refinance, receivable).

# Second Mortgage vs Caveat Loan: Which Is Right for Your Business?

## Introduction

For Australian businesses seeking short-term, property-backed finance, two products often appear similar at first glance: second mortgages and caveat loans. Both sit behind a first mortgage, both rely on property equity, and both are used for business-purpose funding with a defined exit.

But the differences between them are significant. A second mortgage is formally registered on title, providing the lender with clearer rights but requiring more time and sometimes intercreditor agreements. A caveat loan, by contrast, is quicker to arrange because it involves only a caveat lodged on title, but it typically comes with lower loan amounts, shorter terms, and higher pricing.

This guide breaks down the similarities and differences between second mortgages and caveat loans, with worked examples, risks, and practical tips for directors deciding which facility suits their circumstances.

## What Is a Second Mortgage?

A second mortgage is a registered loan that ranks behind an existing first mortgage.

Key features:
- Formally registered with the land titles office
- Lender's rights defined in law and supported by intercreditor or priority deeds
- Typically larger amounts (hundreds of thousands or more)
- Loan terms in months to a few years
- Interest often capitalised, reducing monthly cash flow strain

Second mortgages are suited to funding larger projects, bridging longer timelines, or unlocking equity beyond the limits of a caveat loan.

## What Is a Caveat Loan?

A caveat loan involves the lender lodging a caveat on title, rather than registering a mortgage.

Key features:
- Fastest to arrange — often within 48–72 hours
- Typically smaller amounts ($50k–$500k)
- Loan terms short — weeks to a few months
- Higher pricing (2–4% per month not uncommon)
- Exit must be clear and dated (sale, refinance, receivable)

Caveat loans are designed for urgency — preserving contracts, covering tax arrears, or bridging to short-term receivables.

## Similarities Between the Two

Both second mortgages and caveat loans:
- Sit behind a first mortgage
- Are secured by property equity
- Rely heavily on Loan-to-Value Ratios (LVR) to determine eligibility
- Require clear, dated exits
- Are structured for business-purpose lending only

## Key Differences: Second Mortgage vs Caveat Loan

| Feature | Second Mortgage | Caveat Loan |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Registration | Full registration on title | Caveat lodged on title only |
| Time to settle | Days to weeks (longer if intercreditor deed required) | Fastest, often 1–3 days |
| Loan size | Larger, can stretch to millions | Smaller, often <$500k |
| LVR cap | 75–80% combined | 50–65% |
| Cost | 1–2% per month typical | 2–4% per month |
| Term | Months to years | Weeks to months |
| Best for | Larger projects, medium-term funding | Urgent, short-term funding |

## When to Use a Second Mortgage

Second mortgages are better suited when:
- **The loan amount is large** — hundreds of thousands or millions
- **Timelines allow for full registration** (including deeds if required)
- **Exit is longer-term** (e.g., project completion, refinance after 12 months)
- **A stronger legal position is preferred** by both borrower and lender

## When to Use a Caveat Loan

Caveat loans are appropriate when:
- **Urgency is critical** — deadlines within days
- **Loan size is modest** — bridging $50k–$500k gaps
- **Exit is imminent** — a contracted sale or receivable within weeks
- **Directors can accept higher pricing** in exchange for speed

## Worked Example 1: Choosing a Second Mortgage

A developer requires $800k to finish a project. The exit is a refinance in 9 months once new financials are available.

- Property equity supports a combined LVR of 70%
- A caveat loan would be too small and too short in term
- **A second mortgage provides the required size and timeline**

## Worked Example 2: Choosing a Caveat Loan

A logistics company needs $250k within 5 days to settle tax arrears and preserve contracts.

- Equity exists in property with 60% LVR
- Timeline too short for intercreditor deed
- **A caveat loan is approved in 72 hours**, interest capitalised, and repaid after receivable clears in 8 weeks

## Risks to Watch

**Second mortgages**: Risk of delays with deed negotiation; balance growth with capitalised interest.

**Caveat loans**: Risk of over-gearing, higher costs, and short timelines.

Directors should assess risk against urgency and size of funding required.

## Checklist for Directors

- Calculate combined LVR including first mortgage
- Assess urgency — do you need funds in days or weeks?
- Confirm exit event and timeline
- Weigh cost vs convenience
- Gather documents — title, first mortgage statement, exit evidence, company details

## Conclusion

Second mortgages and caveat loans both provide business-purpose funding behind a first mortgage, but they serve very different use cases. Second mortgages suit larger, medium-term projects where legal certainty matters. Caveat loans serve urgent, short-term needs where speed trumps cost.

Understanding the differences allows directors to approach private lenders with clarity and confidence, improving approval odds and ensuring the right tool is chosen for the job.

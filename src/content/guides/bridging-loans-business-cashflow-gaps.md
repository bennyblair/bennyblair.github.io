# How Bridging Loans Help Businesses Manage Cashflow Gaps

Australian businesses often face timing mismatches between expenses and income. Bridging loans provide short-term funding secured against property to smooth these cashflow gaps. Unlike overdrafts or invoice finance, bridging loans are asset-backed, flexible in use, and often approved faster than traditional bank lending. This guide explains how they work, when to use them, eligibility and costs, common risks, and practical alternatives. Written for business-purpose borrowers in Australia — not financial or credit advice.

## What is a Bridging Loan for Business?

- A short-term loan secured against commercial or investment property.
- Designed to cover immediate expenses while waiting for receivables, settlement proceeds, or refinance.
- Repayment usually occurs when the expected inflow lands.

## Common Cashflow Gap Scenarios

- **Property settlement**: Funds required before an existing sale settles.
- **ATO liabilities**: Urgent tax or BAS arrears threatening business continuity.
- **Supplier payments**: Covering deposits or final balances to keep projects on track.
- **Seasonal cycles**: Stock build-ups ahead of holiday or peak trading.
- **Contract-driven gaps**: Retention or progress claims delaying inflows.

## Eligibility & Security

- Borrowers must operate under an ABN; loans are for business-purpose only.
- **Security**: Commercial or investment property with available equity.
- LVRs typically capped at 65–70%.
- Directors' guarantees standard.
- Clear exit plan essential (sale, refinance, receivable).

## Typical Costs & Terms

- **Interest**: 1.0%–2.2% per month, depending on risk and priority.
- **Fees**: Establishment 2%–4%, plus legal and valuation costs.
- **Term**: 1–12 months.
- **Repayment**: Often lump sum at exit, sometimes interest-prepaid.

## Process & Timelines

1. **Scenario triage**: Review of property, purpose, exit.
2. **Indicative terms**: Typically within 48 hours.
3. **Valuation and docs**: Can be expedited with desktop valuations.
4. **Settlement**: Often 5–10 business days, faster if caveat-based.

## Risks & Red Flags

- Exit delays may increase costs and create refinancing stress.
- Over-reliance on bridging can mask deeper structural cashflow problems.
- High fees and capitalised interest may erode margins.
- Lenders require robust exit evidence; weak plans may block approval.

## Alternatives to Bridging Loans

- **Invoice finance**: Unlock receivables faster.
- **Overdrafts**: Flexible, ongoing access via banks (if approved).
- **Second mortgages**: Better for longer terms with clear equity.
- **Equity injections**: Investors or shareholder loans may reduce reliance on debt.

## Illustrative Example

A Melbourne importer faces a $600k supplier invoice due in two weeks, while a $1.5m receivable is expected in six weeks. Using an investment property with 65% LVR headroom, the business secures a bridging loan with capitalised interest. The supplier is paid on time, shipments proceed, and the receivable repays the loan, avoiding penalties.

# Business Loans Without Financials: How Private Lenders Assess Risk

For many Australian businesses, especially SMEs, producing up-to-date financials isn't always possible. Banks require tax returns, audited accounts, and detailed forecasts before approving credit — but private lenders take a different approach.

In the private market, facilities such as caveat loans, second mortgages, and bridging loans are often approved without full financial statements. Instead, lenders rely on property security, exit strategies, and director guarantees. This guide explains how private lenders assess deals without financials, when it works, the risks involved, and practical tips for directors.

## Why Banks Require Financials

Banks operate under APRA-regulated frameworks. To meet responsible lending obligations, they require detailed proof of serviceability, including:

- Tax returns (2–3 years)
- Audited financial statements
- Profit and loss forecasts
- Evidence of consistent revenue

This makes bank loans slow and often unattainable for businesses in transition, restructuring, or growth phases.

## How Private Lenders Assess Deals Without Financials

Private lenders focus less on past earnings and more on asset backing and repayment certainty. Key factors include:

- **Property security**: The type, location, and value of the property securing the loan
- **Combined LVR**: Conservative ratios (65–75%) ensure buffer against market changes
- **Exit strategy**: A dated sale, receivable, or refinance that will repay the loan
- **Director guarantees**: Personal backing from directors
- **Supporting documents**: BAS, bank statements, or contracts may be requested, even if formal accounts aren't available

## When This Works Best

Loans without financials make sense when:

- **Urgency is critical**: Deadlines cannot wait for accountants to finalise numbers
- **Equity is strong**: Property values provide sufficient buffer
- **Exit is clear**: Repayment is tied to a dated, verifiable event
- **Businesses in transition**: Start-ups, fast-growth companies, or those restructuring often lack polished accounts but have valuable assets

**Example**: A transport company with no recent tax returns needs $400k to secure a fleet contract. With $2m equity in property and a signed receivable, a private lender may approve based on security and exit alone.

## Risks of Borrowing Without Financials

While private loans can be approved quickly without formal accounts, there are risks:

- **Over-gearing**: Without financials, repayment capacity is less certain
- **Higher costs**: Pricing reflects higher risk and shorter terms
- **Exit reliance**: If the exit fails, refinancing may be difficult without updated financials

Directors should only use these facilities with a credible repayment plan.

## Practical Tips for Businesses

- **Prepare a clean file**: Even without accounts, provide BAS, contracts, and bank statements
- **Be realistic on LVR**: Stay below lender caps to leave room for errors
- **Document the exit**: Lenders need to see repayment clearly mapped
- **Plan for refinance**: Update financials during the term to refinance into cheaper, longer-term options

## Conclusion

Private lenders can fund businesses without financials, focusing on assets and exits rather than historic statements. This flexibility allows businesses to move quickly when banks cannot, but the higher costs and risks mean directors should use these loans strategically, not as long-term funding.

## FAQs

**Can I get a loan without financials in Australia?**
Yes, private lenders often approve facilities based on property security and exit strategies instead of full financial statements.

**What do lenders look at instead of financials?**
They examine security property, combined LVR, director guarantees, and evidence of repayment events.

**Are loans without financials more expensive?**
Yes. Interest rates are higher to reflect the increased risk.

**What documents should I prepare?**
BAS, bank statements, and contracts help lenders assess viability, even if accounts are missing.

**Can these loans be refinanced later?**
Yes. Many borrowers use private loans as a bridge until financials are updated and banks can refinance.

No. They are business-purpose loans only.

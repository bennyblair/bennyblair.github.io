# Caveat Loans in Australia: Fast Finance for Urgent Business Needs

## Introduction

When speed matters most, businesses can't always wait weeks or months for a bank to process finance applications. Contracts need to be settled, tax arrears need to be cleared, and supplier payments need to be made on time. For Australian businesses in these situations, caveat loans provide one of the fastest paths to property-secured finance.

Unlike first or second mortgages, which involve full registration and sometimes complex intercreditor deeds, caveat loans use a legal caveat lodged on the property title. This makes them quicker to arrange and suitable for urgent, short-term funding.

This guide explains what caveat loans are, how they work, when they make sense, and what risks to watch out for. It also includes practical examples, a borrower checklist, FAQs, and comparisons with other lending options.

## What Is a Caveat Loan?

A caveat loan is a short-term facility secured by lodging a caveat over a property title. The caveat prevents the owner from dealing with the property (selling, transferring, or further encumbering it) without first addressing the lender's interest.

Key points:
- Usually small-to-medium sized loans (e.g., $50k–$500k)
- Settlement in days, sometimes less than 48 hours
- Strictly short-term, often 1–6 months
- Repayment linked to a known exit, such as sale, refinance, or receivables

## How Caveat Loans Differ From Mortgages

| Feature | Caveat Loan | Second Mortgage | First Mortgage |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Registration | Caveat only, not a full mortgage | Registered on title, behind first | Registered with first priority |
| Speed | Fastest (1–5 days) | Slower (may need intercreditor deed) | Slowest (bank process) |
| Loan size | Smaller (50–65% LVR cap) | Medium (75–80% combined cap) | Largest |
| Duration | Short (weeks–months) | Medium (months–years) | Long-term (years) |
| Use case | Urgent cash needs | Project funding, bridging | Standard business or property finance |

## When Businesses Use Caveat Loans

Caveat loans are most suitable when:
- **Funding is needed urgently**: Settlement deadlines or ATO arrears
- **Loan size is modest**: $50k–$500k is typical
- **Exit is clear and dated**: Sale contract, refinance, or signed receivable
- **Equity exists but time is short**: The property has value, but there's no time to register a full mortgage

## Advantages of Caveat Loans

- **Speed**: Fastest settlement of all property-backed facilities
- **Simplicity**: Limited documentation compared to banks
- **Cash flow relief**: Interest often capitalised, removing monthly servicing
- **Accessibility**: Suitable for businesses without full financials

## Risks of Caveat Loans

- **Higher pricing**: Interest typically 2–4% per month
- **Short terms**: Loans expire quickly; extensions can be costly
- **Exit risk**: Without a certain exit, borrowers can face enforcement
- **Limited amounts**: Lower LVR caps reduce borrowing power

## Worked Example 1: Urgent ATO Debt

A transport company receives a $250k ATO notice payable within 7 days. Without payment, contracts may be cancelled.

- **Property equity**: $900k investment property with $300k first mortgage
- **Combined LVR after loan**: 61%
- **Loan approved in 3 days**, interest capitalised
- **Exit**: Refinance into term debt after accounts are finalised

## Worked Example 2: Settlement Deadline

A small developer faces settlement on a land purchase but bank funds are delayed.

- **Loan required**: $400k for 6 weeks
- **Security**: Caveat over director's residential investment property
- **Exit**: Bank funds settle later; caveat loan repaid

The loan preserved the deal that would otherwise have collapsed.

## Checklist: Preparing for a Caveat Loan

- Title search for property security
- Evidence of equity and first mortgage balance
- Exit documentation (contract, refinance letter, receivable)
- Company docs (ACN, constitution)
- BAS or bank statements (to show business activity)

## Alternatives to Caveat Loans

- **Second mortgages**: Larger amounts but slower to arrange
- **Invoice finance**: Useful if receivables drive the need
- **Overdrafts**: Cheaper but require strong bank relationships
- **Equity injection**: From directors or investors, though slower

## Conclusion

Caveat loans are one of the fastest finance tools available to Australian businesses. They provide critical breathing space when urgent obligations arise, but they should only be used with a clear and dated exit. Treated as a short-term solution, they can preserve contracts, unlock opportunities, and prevent damaging defaults.

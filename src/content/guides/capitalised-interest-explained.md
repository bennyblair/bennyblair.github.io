# Capitalised Interest Explained: How It Works in Private Lending

One feature that sets private lending apart from traditional bank loans is the option to capitalise interest. For businesses under cash flow pressure, not having to make monthly interest payments can be a lifesaver. Instead, the interest accrues and is added to the loan balance, to be repaid at the end of the term.

But while capitalisation improves short-term liquidity, it also carries risks. Loan balances grow over time, and the total exit requirement can be higher than directors expect. This article explains how capitalised interest works, when it makes sense, and what pitfalls to watch out for.

## What Is Capitalised Interest?

Capitalised interest is interest that is not paid monthly but instead added to the outstanding loan balance.

**Example**: A $500,000 loan at 1.5% per month. Instead of paying $7,500 each month, the interest is rolled into the loan. After 6 months, the balance increases by $45,000 to $545,000 (excluding fees).

This allows businesses to preserve cash during the term but creates a larger repayment at exit.

## Why Lenders Offer It

Private lenders know that many businesses seek short-term funding because of cashflow constraints. Capitalising interest:

- Removes the burden of monthly servicing
- Simplifies loan administration  
- Aligns repayment with the exit event (sale, receivable, refinance)

It is particularly common in bridging loans and second mortgages.

## When Capitalised Interest Makes Sense

Capitalising interest can be appropriate when:

- **The loan is short-term**: Weeks or months, not years
- **Exit is dated and certain**: e.g., a contracted settlement or signed receivable
- **Cash flow must be preserved**: Funds are better used to complete projects or pay suppliers

**Example**: A property developer borrows $400,000 for 4 months to finish works. By capitalising interest, the entire budget goes into completion, unlocking settlement revenue.

## Risks of Capitalised Interest

While helpful, capitalisation carries important risks:

- **Balance growth**: The loan amount increases each month, requiring a larger exit
- **Exit pressure**: If settlement is delayed, the growing balance may exceed available funds
- **Reduced buffer**: Higher balances mean higher LVRs, eroding margin for error
- **Extension fees**: If the exit slips, extensions add further costs on top of capitalised amounts

## Alternatives to Consider

- **Servicing interest monthly**: Suitable if cash flow allows and the loan term is longer
- **Partial capitalisation**: Some lenders allow partial servicing, reducing balance growth
- **Bank overdrafts or invoice finance**: May provide cheaper liquidity if available

## Worked Example

A manufacturer takes a $600,000 second mortgage for 9 months at 1.25% per month.

| **Monthly interest** | $7,500 |
| **Capitalised, total interest** | $67,500 |
| **Repayment balance** | $667,500 plus fees |

If the refinance is delayed by 3 months, interest adds another $22,500, raising the balance to $690,000. The business must ensure the exit covers this larger figure.

## Conclusion

Capitalised interest can provide breathing space by removing monthly repayments, but directors must model total exit balances carefully. It is a useful tool when exits are certain and short-term, but risky if timelines are uncertain. Treat it as a convenience, not a license to over-borrow.

## FAQs

**What is capitalised interest?**
It is interest added to the loan balance instead of being paid monthly.

**Why do businesses use it?**
It frees up cash flow for operations during the loan term.

**Is it more expensive than regular interest?**
The rate is the same, but the balance grows, so total repayment is higher.

**What happens if the exit is delayed?**
The balance continues to grow, increasing repayment pressure.

**Do banks offer capitalised interest?**
Rarely. It is mainly a feature of private lenders.

**Can capitalised interest push LVR too high?**
Yes. As balances grow, the LVR may breach limits, reducing flexibility.

## Glossary

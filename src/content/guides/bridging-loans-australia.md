# Bridging Loans in Australia: How They Help Businesses Manage Timing Gaps

Business timing doesn't always align neatly with cash flow. A property settlement might be weeks away while a supplier demands payment today. A contract milestone may trigger a receivable in 90 days, but staff and materials need funding now. These timing gaps are where bridging loans can play a vital role for Australian businesses.

A bridging loan is a short-term facility designed to provide liquidity until a clearly defined cash event occurs. It is not a substitute for long-term finance, but rather a specialist tool for covering urgent shortfalls when the exit is certain and dated. This article explains how bridging loans work, when they are used, the risks involved, and how they compare with alternatives such as caveat loans or second mortgages.

## What Is a Bridging Loan?

A bridging loan is a short-term facility secured by property, designed to "bridge" the gap between an outgoing cash obligation and an incoming cash inflow.

Unlike traditional loans, bridging finance is inherently temporary. The loan is advanced with the expectation of repayment from a specific event, such as:

- The sale of a property
- The settlement of a contracted receivable
- The refinance of an existing facility once financials are in place

Because they are structured around a dated exit, bridging loans are generally short in duration — often measured in weeks or a few months — and are priced accordingly.

## When Businesses Use Bridging Loans

Bridging loans are particularly valuable when cash is needed now but repayment is clearly visible. Common use cases include:

- **Property settlement timing**: Funding the purchase of one property before another has settled
- **Project completion**: Covering final construction or fit-out costs before a contracted settlement or progress claim
- **ATO or regulatory payments**: Paying arrears or obligations quickly to keep a project or contract alive while a longer-term refinance is prepared
- **Short-term working capital**: Financing payroll or inventory to secure an opportunity ahead of a dated receivable

**Example**: A builder expecting a $1.5m receivable in 60 days may take a $400k bridging loan to cover subcontractors and materials. Once the receivable clears, the bridging facility is repaid.

## Costs and Terms

Bridging loans are structured for speed and certainty, which affects pricing:

| **Interest** | 0.8%–1.8% per month (interest-only) |
| **Term** | 1–12 months (extensions possible) |
| **LVR/Advance** | Up to ~70% 1st mortgage; ~55–65% 2nd (asset/val dependent) |
| **Security** | 1st/2nd mortgage over investment or commercial property; caveat |
| **Typical fees** | Establishment 1.5%–3.5% + legal/valuation |

These are indicative only and vary by lender, asset quality and exit.

## Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for a bridging loan, businesses typically need:

- ABN & photo ID
- Rates notice & title search
- Purpose & exit strategy
- Assets & liabilities statement
- Leases (if income-supporting)
- Valuation (if required)

## Process & Timelines

The bridging loan process typically involves:

1. **Outline objectives & exit**
2. **Price/structure options**
3. **Credit pack & conditions**
4. **Signing**
5. **Funding**

**Case Study**: NSW wholesaler used bridging loan financing to raise $1,200,000. Structure: approx 65% LVR, 6-month term. Indicative terms in 24–48h; settlement in 7 business days. Fees: 3.0% establishment + legals. Security and pricing always depend on the asset and exit.

## Risks and Considerations

While bridging loans are effective, they carry risks if not managed carefully:

- **Exit slippage**: If the sale or receivable is delayed, the facility may need extending at further cost
- **Over-gearing**: High LVRs leave little buffer against market movements or unexpected expenses
- **Consent requirements**: If a first mortgage exists, lender consent or a deed may be required, slowing settlement

Mitigation involves conservative gearing, realistic exit assumptions, and building in timing buffers.

## Alternatives to Consider

- **Caveat loans**: Faster, smaller facilities for very short-term gaps
- **Second mortgages**: Larger facilities for 6–12 month purposes
- **Invoice finance**: Unlocks liquidity from receivables, avoiding property security
- **Equity injections**: Reduce reliance on debt where possible

Each tool has its place; bridging loans sit in the middle for size and timeframe.

## Conclusion

Bridging loans can be highly effective for Australian businesses dealing with short-term funding gaps. They provide certainty when the exit is clear and dated, allowing operations to continue smoothly. But they are costly and should never be used without a credible repayment plan.

## FAQs

**What are common uses for bridging loans?**
Funding settlements, completing projects, paying urgent obligations, or covering working capital before receivables.

**What are the risks?**
Exit delays, over-gearing, and unexpected costs can cause default or high extensions.

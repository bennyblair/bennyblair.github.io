# Bridging Loans in Australia: How They Help Businesses Manage Timing Gaps

Business timing doesn't always align neatly with cash flow. A property settlement might be weeks away while a supplier demands payment today. A contract milestone may trigger a receivable in 90 days, but staff and materials need funding now. These timing gaps are where bridging loans can play a vital role for Australian businesses.

A bridging loan is a short-term facility designed to provide liquidity until a clearly defined cash event occurs. It is not a substitute for long-term finance, but rather a specialist tool for covering urgent shortfalls when the exit is certain and dated. This article explains how bridging loans work, when they are used, the risks involved, and how they compare with alternatives such as caveat loans or second mortgages.

## What Is a Bridging Loan?

A bridging loan is a short-term facility secured by property, designed to "bridge" the gap between an outgoing cash obligation and an incoming cash inflow.

Unlike traditional loans, bridging finance is inherently temporary. The loan is advanced with the expectation of repayment from a specific event, such as:

- The sale of a property
- The settlement of a contracted receivable
- The refinance of an existing facility once financials are in place

Because they are structured around a dated exit, bridging loans are generally short in duration — often measured in weeks or a few months — and are priced accordingly.

## When Businesses Use Bridging Loans

Bridging loans are particularly valuable when cash is needed now but repayment is clearly visible. Common use cases include:

- **Property settlement timing**: Funding the purchase of one property before another has settled
- **Project completion**: Covering final construction or fit-out costs before a contracted settlement or progress claim
- **ATO or regulatory payments**: Paying arrears or obligations quickly to keep a project or contract alive while a longer-term refinance is prepared
- **Short-term working capital**: Financing payroll or inventory to secure an opportunity ahead of a dated receivable

**Example**: A builder expecting a $1.5m receivable in 60 days may take a $400k bridging loan to cover subcontractors and materials. Once the receivable clears, the bridging facility is repaid.

## Eligibility and Security Requirements

Bridging lenders typically require:

- **Property security**: Residential, commercial, or industrial property, with conservative combined LVRs (often 65–70%)
- **Exit evidence**: Sale contracts, receivable agreements, or refinance approvals
- **Corporate borrower structure**: Facilities are usually taken in the name of the trading entity, with directors' guarantees
- **Supporting documents**: Title searches, ASIC extracts, bank statements, and sometimes valuations

Because bridging loans are short-term and exit-driven, lenders care less about historical financial performance than about the certainty of the exit.

## Costs, Fees, and Terms

Bridging loans are more expensive than long-term bank finance, reflecting their short-term, urgent nature. Borrowers can expect:

- Interest rates of 1–2% per month, sometimes higher depending on risk
- Establishment fees of 1–2% of the facility amount
- Legal and valuation costs payable by the borrower
- Terms of 1–6 months, occasionally up to 12 months if the exit is credible

## Worked Example

A transport business needs $600,000 to purchase fleet upgrades. A property sale is contracted to settle in four months with net proceeds of $1.8m.

| **Item** | **Amount** |
|----------|------------|
| Loan | $600,000 bridging loan |
| Interest | 1.25% per month (capitalised) |
| Fees | 2% establishment = $12,000 |
| **Total cost over 4 months** | **≈ $42,000** |

Because the sale is dated and sufficient to cover the repayment, the bridging facility provides certainty without long-term commitments.

## Settlement Process and Timelines

The speed of bridging loan settlement depends on several factors:

### For First Mortgages
- **3-7 days**: When the bridging loan will be the first registered mortgage
- Clean title, straightforward documentation

### For Second Position
- **1-3 weeks**: When existing first mortgage requires intercreditor deed
- May require consent from existing lender

### Documentation Required
- ASIC company searches and constitutional documents
- Property title and valuations
- Evidence of exit (contracts, refinance approvals, receivable agreements)
- Director identification and guarantees
- Recent bank statements and BAS

## Risks and Red Flags

While bridging loans are effective, they carry risks if not managed carefully:

- **Exit slippage**: If the sale or receivable is delayed, the facility may need extending at further cost
- **Over-gearing**: High LVRs leave little buffer against market movements or unexpected expenses
- **Consent requirements**: If a first mortgage exists, lender consent or a deed may be required, slowing settlement
- **Market conditions**: Property values or receivable collectability may deteriorate

Mitigation involves conservative gearing, realistic exit assumptions, and building in timing buffers.

## Alternatives to Consider

- **Caveat loans**: Faster, smaller facilities for very short-term gaps
- **Second mortgages**: Larger facilities for 6–12 month purposes
- **Invoice finance**: Unlocks liquidity from receivables, avoiding property security
- **Equity injections**: Reduce reliance on debt where possible

Each tool has its place; bridging loans sit in the middle for size and timeframe.

## Conclusion

Bridging loans can be highly effective for Australian businesses dealing with short-term funding gaps. They provide certainty when the exit is clear and dated, allowing operations to continue smoothly. But they are costly and should never be used without a credible repayment plan. For directors, the key is to treat bridging loans as a temporary bridge — not as a permanent solution.

## FAQs

**What is a bridging loan?**
A short-term loan secured by property, designed to cover funding gaps until a dated cash inflow occurs.

**How long do bridging loans usually run?**
Typically between 1 and 6 months, depending on the exit. Some stretch to 12 months if justified.

**What are common uses for bridging loans?**
Funding settlements, completing projects, paying urgent obligations, or covering working capital before receivables.

**What are the risks?**
Exit delays, over-gearing, and unexpected costs can cause default or high extensions.

No. They are business-purpose only and not suitable for owner-occupied or personal use.

**Can interest be capitalised?**
Yes, many lenders allow capitalisation so cashflow is not drained during the term.

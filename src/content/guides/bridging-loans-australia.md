# Bridging Loans in Australia: How They Work for Businesses

When cash flow timing doesn't align with business opportunities or obligations, bridging loans offer a solution. These short-term facilities help Australian businesses navigate timing gaps by providing immediate liquidity secured against property, with repayment tied to specific future events.

Understanding when and how to use bridging finance can mean the difference between missing critical opportunities and maintaining business momentum during challenging periods.

## What Are Bridging Loans?

A bridging loan is a short-term commercial finance facility secured by real estate, designed to "bridge" the gap between an immediate funding need and a clearly defined future cash inflow. Unlike traditional business loans focused on cash flow capacity, bridging loans are structured around specific exit events.

### Key Characteristics

**Short-term nature**: Typically 1-12 months, with most facilities under 6 months
**Property security**: Secured by residential, commercial, or industrial real estate
**Exit-driven**: Repayment depends on specific events like property sales, refinancing, or contracted receivables
**Quick settlement**: Can settle within days when documentation is straightforward

The temporary nature distinguishes bridging loans from other commercial finance options. They're not meant to replace long-term funding but to provide immediate liquidity while permanent solutions are arranged.

## Common Business Use Cases

Australian businesses use bridging loans across various scenarios where timing creates funding gaps:

### Property Transactions
- **Settlement timing**: Purchasing property before existing assets settle
- **Auction deposits**: Securing properties at auction before financing is arranged
- **Development completion**: Funding final stages before construction finance converts

### Business Operations
- **Working capital gaps**: Covering payroll, inventory, or supplier payments ahead of receivables
- **Contract mobilisation**: Funding equipment or materials for large contracts before progress payments
- **Tax obligations**: Meeting ATO deadlines while arranging longer-term refinancing

### Strategic Opportunities
- **Asset acquisition**: Purchasing equipment, businesses, or inventory at time-sensitive opportunities
- **Debt consolidation**: Replacing multiple expensive facilities with structured refinancing
- **Emergency funding**: Addressing urgent cash needs to prevent business disruption

### Worked Example: Construction Business

A building contractor wins a $2.5 million government contract requiring immediate mobilisation. Progress payments begin in 60 days, but $400,000 is needed now for materials and subcontractors.

**Solution**: $400,000 bridging loan secured against the company's workshop property
**Term**: 3 months
**Exit**: First progress payment plus short-term business loan
**Cost**: Approximately $18,000 in interest and fees

This allows the contractor to commence work immediately, ensuring contract compliance and cash flow continuity.

## Eligibility and Security Requirements

Bridging loan approval focuses on security and exit certainty rather than traditional serviceability metrics.

### Property Security Requirements
**Acceptable security types**:
- Commercial properties (offices, warehouses, retail)
- Industrial properties (factories, workshops)
- Residential investment properties
- Development sites with appropriate permits

**Loan-to-Value Ratios (LVRs)**:
- First mortgage position: Up to 70-80% LVR
- Second mortgage position: Combined LVRs typically 65-75%
- Conservative valuations protect against market volatility

### Borrower Eligibility
**Corporate structure**: Loans typically made to trading entities with director guarantees
**Exit evidence**: Clear documentation of repayment source (contracts, sale agreements, refinance approvals)
**Legal capacity**: Proper corporate authorisation and power to grant security

### Documentation Requirements
- Current ASIC company searches and constitutional documents
- Property titles and recent valuations
- Evidence of exit event (sale contracts, receivable agreements, refinance pre-approvals)
- Recent bank statements and BAS submissions
- Director identification and personal guarantees
- Insurance certificates for secured properties

## Costs, Pricing Structures, and Timelines

Bridging loans command premium pricing reflecting their short-term, urgent nature and property-secured structure.

### Interest Rates
**Typical range**: 1.0% to 2.5% per month
**Factors affecting pricing**:
- Loan size and LVR
- Security quality and location
- Exit certainty and timeframe
- Borrower relationship and credit quality

### Fees and Charges
**Establishment fees**: 1-3% of facility amount
**Legal costs**: $2,000-$8,000 depending on complexity
**Valuation fees**: $800-$3,000 per property
**Registration costs**: Government charges for mortgage registration
**Ongoing fees**: Line fees or unused facility charges may apply

### Interest Payment Options
**Capitalised interest**: Interest added to loan balance (preserves cash flow)
**Monthly payments**: Interest paid monthly (reduces total cost)
**End-of-term payment**: All interest and principal due at maturity

### Settlement Timelines

**First mortgage position**: 3-7 business days
- Clean title documentation
- Straightforward security
- All approvals in place

**Second mortgage position**: 1-3 weeks
- Requires intercreditor deed with first mortgagee
- Additional due diligence
- First lender consent processes

**Complex transactions**: 2-4 weeks
- Multiple securities
- Cross-default provisions
- Detailed exit documentation

## Risks and Exit Strategies

While effective, bridging loans carry inherent risks requiring careful management.

### Primary Risks

**Exit delay risk**: The most significant risk occurs when expected repayment events are delayed
- Property sales may not settle on schedule
- Receivables might be disputed or delayed
- Refinancing can take longer than anticipated

**Mitigation strategies**:
- Build timing buffers into planning
- Have backup exit options
- Maintain regular communication with all parties

**Market risk**: Property values may decline during the loan term
- Reduces security buffer
- May affect refinancing capacity
- Can complicate exit execution

**Interest escalation**: Monthly compounding can rapidly increase debt
- Capitalised interest grows the principal
- Extended terms multiply costs
- Cash flow pressure may increase

### Exit Strategy Planning

**Primary exit**: The main expected repayment source
**Secondary exit**: Alternative repayment method if primary is delayed
**Tertiary exit**: Emergency options including asset sales or equity injection

Successful bridging requires multiple exit scenarios and realistic timeframes.

## Worked Example: Property Development

A developer needs $800,000 to complete a residential subdivision before presales settle.

**Loan details**:
- Amount: $800,000
- Security: Existing commercial property worth $1.8 million
- LVR: 45% (conservative)
- Rate: 1.5% per month
- Term: 4 months
- Exit: Presale settlements totalling $2.1 million

**Cost breakdown**:
- Interest (4 months): $48,000
- Establishment fee (2%): $16,000
- Legal and valuation: $4,000
- **Total cost**: $68,000

**Return on investment**: The $800,000 enables completion of a project generating $300,000 profit, making the $68,000 cost commercially viable.

## Alternatives to Bridging Loans

Several financing options may be more appropriate depending on circumstances:

### Caveat Loans
**Best for**: Very short-term needs (days to weeks)
**Advantages**: Extremely fast settlement (24-48 hours)
**Disadvantages**: Higher rates, smaller amounts, limited security options

### Second Mortgages
**Best for**: Medium-term funding (6-18 months)
**Advantages**: Lower rates than bridging, longer terms
**Disadvantages**: Slower settlement, more documentation

### Invoice Finance
**Best for**: Ongoing working capital backed by receivables
**Advantages**: No property security required, scalable
**Disadvantages**: Limited to businesses with suitable receivables

### Trade Finance
**Best for**: Import/export businesses with timing gaps
**Advantages**: Specialised for trade cycles
**Disadvantages**: Limited to trade-related purposes

### Asset Finance
**Best for**: Equipment or vehicle acquisition
**Advantages**: Asset-specific security
**Disadvantages**: Limited to specific asset types

The optimal choice depends on funding amount, timeframe, purpose, and available security.

## FAQs

**Q: How quickly can a bridging loan settle?**
A: First mortgage bridging loans can settle within 3-7 business days with proper documentation. Second mortgages typically require 1-3 weeks due to intercreditor agreements.

**Q: What happens if my exit event is delayed?**
A: Most lenders offer extensions for additional fees and interest. However, extended terms significantly increase costs, so backup exit strategies are essential.

**Q: Can I use residential property as security for business bridging loans?**
A: Yes, residential investment properties can secure business bridging loans. Owner-occupied homes require careful consideration of personal risk exposure.

**Q: Is there a minimum loan amount for bridging finance?**
A: Most lenders have minimums of $100,000-$300,000. Smaller amounts may be available but with proportionally higher costs.

**Q: Can interest be capitalised to preserve cash flow?**
A: Yes, most bridging lenders allow interest capitalisation, though this increases the total amount owing and must be considered in exit planning.

**Q: What if my primary exit doesn't eventuate?**
A: This is why secondary and tertiary exit strategies are crucial. Options include refinancing to longer-term facilities, asset sales, or equity injections.

**Q: Are bridging loans suitable for start-up businesses?**
A: Generally no. Bridging loans work best for established businesses with clear exit events and adequate property security.

## Glossary of Key Terms

**LVR (Loan-to-Value Ratio)**: The percentage of property value being borrowed against. A $500,000 loan against a $1 million property represents a 50% LVR.

**Priority Deed**: Legal document establishing the ranking of multiple mortgages over the same property, determining repayment order in default situations.

**Exit Event**: The specific future occurrence expected to generate repayment funds, such as property settlement, receivable collection, or refinancing completion.

**Capitalised Interest**: Interest charges added to the loan principal rather than paid monthly, preserving borrower cash flow but increasing total debt.

**Intercreditor Deed**: Agreement between multiple lenders securing the same property, establishing their respective rights and obligations.

**Cross Default**: Clause causing default under one facility to trigger default under related facilities, requiring careful management in complex structures.

**Serviceability**: A borrower's capacity to meet ongoing interest and principal payments from business cash flow.

**Security Realisation**: The process of selling secured property to recover loan amounts in default situations.

## Conclusion

Bridging loans serve as valuable tools for Australian businesses navigating timing challenges and opportunities. Their strength lies in providing immediate liquidity when exit events are clearly defined and properly documented.

Success with bridging finance requires careful planning, conservative security margins, realistic exit timeframes, and backup strategies. While costs are higher than traditional finance, the ability to maintain business momentum or capture time-sensitive opportunities often justifies the expense.

For businesses considering bridging loans, professional advice ensures the facility structure aligns with commercial objectives while managing inherent risks effectively.

# Invoice Finance vs Property Loans: Which Funding Tool Fits Your Business?

## Introduction

When a business needs capital, the instinct is often to turn to property — drawing on equity through a second mortgage or bridging facility. But property isn't the only source of funding. Invoice finance offers an alternative path, allowing businesses to unlock working capital directly from receivables without tying up property assets.

Choosing between invoice finance and property loans depends on the business's circumstances: the assets it can pledge, the timing of its cash flow, and the size of its funding need. This guide compares invoice finance and property-backed loans, explaining when each works best, their costs, risks, and practical applications. Information is general only and not financial or credit advice.

## What Is Invoice Finance?

Invoice finance is a facility that advances funds against a company's unpaid invoices. Instead of waiting 30, 60, or 90 days for customers to pay, a business can access a percentage (typically 70–85%) of the invoice value immediately. When the customer pays, the lender takes repayment and the balance is released.

This funding method is tied directly to receivables, making it ideal for businesses with strong debtor ledgers but limited property assets. It scales with sales volume rather than property equity.

## What Are Property Loans?

Property loans, such as second mortgages, caveat loans, or bridging loans, are secured by real estate. They typically deliver larger lump sums and are repaid through property sales, refinances, or other defined exits.

While property-backed facilities are powerful, they depend heavily on asset values and available equity. For businesses with little or no property, they may not be viable.

## When to Use Invoice Finance

Invoice finance works best when:

- The business has a strong, diversified debtor base
- Funding needs are ongoing rather than one-off
- The goal is to unlock cash tied in receivables without using property as collateral
- Growth is rapid and working capital cannot keep pace

**Example**: A wholesaler with $2m in monthly sales and 60-day payment terms can access 80% of invoices within 24 hours, creating a rolling line of liquidity that grows with revenue.

## When to Use Property Loans

Property loans suit situations where:

- Larger lump sums are needed (hundreds of thousands to millions)
- Equity exists in real estate
- The purpose is project-based or time-bound
- Capitalised interest is preferred to avoid monthly servicing

**Example**: A transport company needs $1m to acquire additional fleet. It uses a second mortgage over a warehouse with strong equity, with repayment expected from a refinance within 12 months.

## Key Differences Between Invoice Finance and Property Loans

- Security: Invoice finance relies on receivables; property loans rely on real estate
- Speed: Invoice finance can fund within 24–48 hours once ledgers are verified. Caveat loans can be similarly fast; second mortgages are slower
- Scalability: Invoice finance grows with sales; property loans are capped by asset equity
- Repayment: Invoice finance self-liquidates as debtors pay. Property loans rely on sales or refinance
- Cost: Invoice finance fees are typically a % of invoices; property loan costs are interest-based plus establishment fees

## Risks to Consider

**Invoice finance risks**: If debtors delay or default, funding availability drops. Concentrated debtor exposure increases risk.

**Property loan risks**: Over-gearing or exit failure may force asset sales. Market downturns can reduce equity buffers.

Both tools require careful planning and conservative assumptions.

## Combining Both Tools

Some businesses use both invoice finance and property loans. Invoice finance covers recurring working capital, while property loans fund discrete, larger projects. This blended approach can balance speed, scalability, and lump-sum needs.

## Conclusion

Invoice finance and property loans both provide valuable funding paths for Australian businesses. Invoice finance works best when receivables are strong and ongoing liquidity is needed. Property loans are more suited to large, one-off purposes tied to property exits. The right choice depends on what assets a business can pledge and what problem it needs to solve.

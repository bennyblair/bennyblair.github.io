Commercial property loans enable Australian businesses to purchase, refinance, or develop real estate for operations or investment. Unlike residential mortgages, commercial property finance involves sophisticated assessment of both business capacity and property fundamentals, with loan structures designed around business cash flow, tenant covenants, and property income potential.

The Australian commercial property lending market offers diverse solutions from major banks, regional lenders, and specialist finance providers. Interest rates typically range 5.5-8.5% per annum, with loan-to-value ratios of 60-80% requiring deposits of 20-40% plus acquisition costs. Assessment processes take 4-8 weeks and involve comprehensive property valuation, business financial review, and legal due diligence.

Understanding commercial property loan mechanics, lender requirements, and structure options helps businesses secure appropriate finance while optimising borrowing costs. This guide examines eligibility criteria, interest rates, loan structures, application processes, and strategic considerations for Australian commercial property financing.

## Understanding Commercial Property Loans

Commercial property loans provide financing secured against business real estate including offices, retail premises, industrial facilities, warehouses, and mixed-use developments. These specialised products assess both property merit and borrower capacity, with lending decisions reflecting property income potential, location quality, tenant strength, and business financial performance.

### Types of Commercial Property Finance

Owner-occupier loans finance premises for business operations, with serviceability assessed primarily on business cash flow rather than rental income. These loans typically achieve competitive rates due to reduced vacancy risk and strong borrower motivation to maintain payments protecting operational facilities.

Investment property loans finance properties purchased for rental income, with lenders heavily weighting rental cash flows and tenant covenant strength when determining serviceability. Most lenders apply 20-30% rental income discounts accounting for vacancy periods, management costs, and income volatility.

Development and construction loans provide progressive funding throughout building or renovation projects, with funds advanced against completion milestones. For businesses undertaking significant builds, [construction finance](/resources/guides/construction-finance-australia-complete-guide) offers structured funding aligned with project stages, while development finance suits property developers pursuing commercial projects.

### Commercial Versus Residential Loans

Commercial property loans involve larger amounts, higher interest rates (typically 1-3% above residential), and lower loan-to-value ratios than residential mortgages. Assessment periods extend 4-8 weeks compared to 2-4 weeks for residential loans, reflecting comprehensive property valuation and business financial analysis requirements.

Maximum loan-to-value ratios typically reach 60-80% for commercial properties versus 80-95% for residential purchases, requiring larger deposits and stronger equity positions. Repayment terms commonly span 15-25 years compared to 25-30 years for residential mortgages, resulting in higher regular payments but faster equity accumulation.

## Eligibility and Assessment Criteria

Commercial property loan eligibility depends on business financial strength, property characteristics, and overall transaction structure. Lenders evaluate multiple factors when determining approval and loan terms.

### Business Financial Requirements

Most lenders require 2-3 years of financial statements demonstrating profitable operations and positive cash flow trends. Start-up businesses face significantly higher barriers, often requiring deposits exceeding 50%, director guarantees, or additional security to mitigate perceived lending risks.

Cash flow analysis examines business capacity to service debt obligations while maintaining operations. Lenders calculate debt service coverage ratios by dividing net operating income by total debt service, typically requiring minimum ratios of 1.25-1.50 times to ensure adequate payment buffers.

### Property Assessment Factors

Property type significantly influences lending decisions, with lenders preferring mainstream commercial properties including offices, retail, industrial, and warehouses over specialised assets requiring niche expertise. Location quality affects both valuation and risk assessment, with prime locations in major cities achieving better terms than regional properties.

Tenant and lease considerations critically impact investment property lending. Longer remaining lease terms provide greater income security supporting higher loan-to-value ratios, while properties leased to government entities, ASX-listed companies, or established franchises achieve superior lending terms compared to single small business tenant arrangements.

### Loan-to-Value Ratios and Deposits

Commercial property loans typically require loan-to-value ratios of 60-70%, meaning deposits of 30-40% plus additional funds for stamp duty, legal fees, and due diligence costs. Total cash requirements generally reach 35-45% of purchase prices.

Premium properties in prime locations with strong tenant covenants may achieve 75-80% LVR from select lenders, though these arrangements typically involve interest rate premiums and stricter assessment criteria. Owner-occupier premises often achieve higher ratios than investment properties due to reduced vacancy risk.

Lower loan-to-value ratios typically achieve better interest rates, with rate differentials of 0.25-1% frequently applying between 60% and 70% LVR loans. Conservative borrowing approaches provide protection against property value fluctuations and enhance refinancing flexibility. For property owners seeking to optimise existing loans, [commercial property refinancing](/resources/guides/commercial-property-refinancing-solutions) enables accessing improved terms or additional capital.

## Interest Rates and Loan Structures

Commercial property loan rates typically range 5.5-8.5% per annum depending on property quality, borrower strength, loan-to-value ratio, and lender type. Major banks generally offer the most competitive rates for prime properties with strong tenant covenants, while specialist lenders charge premiums reflecting flexible lending criteria.

### Fixed Versus Variable Rates

Variable rate loans offer flexibility for additional repayments and early discharge without penalties, with rate movements directly impacting borrowing costs. Fixed rate loans provide payment certainty and protection against rising rates, typically carrying premiums of 0.25-0.75% above equivalent variable rates with terms ranging 1-5 years.

Split loan structures combining fixed and variable components balance payment certainty with flexibility. Common allocations include 50/50 or 60/40 splits, though businesses can customise structures matching individual risk tolerance and cash flow circumstances.

### Repayment Structure Options

Interest-only repayments minimise regular payment obligations by deferring principal reduction, typically for initial periods of 1-5 years. This approach suits businesses prioritising cash flow preservation or investors expecting property appreciation to build equity, though it increases total interest costs.

Principal and interest repayments provide systematic loan balance reduction and equity accumulation. Higher regular payments strain cash flow but reduce total borrowing costs and accelerate ownership, particularly beneficial for owner-occupier premises supporting long-term operations.

## Application Process and Documentation

Commercial property loan applications require comprehensive documentation demonstrating business capacity and property merit. Thorough preparation streamlines assessment and substantially improves approval prospects.

### Required Documentation

Business documents include 2-3 years of financial statements, tax returns, BAS statements, and recent management accounts demonstrating current trading performance. Professional accountant preparation enhances credibility and ensures compliance with lending requirements.

Property documents include contracts of sale, valuations, building reports, title searches, and lease agreements. Investment properties require comprehensive tenant documentation including lease agreements, rental histories, and covenant assessments.

Personal documents include director tax returns, asset and liability statements, and identification. Lenders assess director financial positions to evaluate overall transaction risk and guarantee capacity.

### Assessment Timeline

Initial assessment typically occurs within 5-7 business days, with preliminary approval subject to satisfactory property valuation and detailed documentation review. Formal approval follows comprehensive due diligence requiring 4-6 weeks depending on transaction complexity.

Property valuation represents a critical milestone, with independent valuers determining market value and lending security. Valuation outcomes significantly influence loan amounts, with properties valuing below purchase prices requiring additional deposit or transaction renegotiation. For transactions requiring faster completion, [bridging finance](/resources/guides/bridging-finance-australia-complete-property-guide) may provide interim funding solutions.

## Security Requirements and Guarantees

Commercial property loans involve registered first mortgages over financed properties, giving lenders priority claim over assets in default situations. Most loans require director personal guarantees for company borrowers, extending lender recourse to guarantor personal assets beyond secured property holdings.

Cross-collateralisation using multiple properties as security enables higher borrowing capacity and supports portfolio growth. However, this approach creates interconnected security where default risks extend across portfolios and individual property sales require lender consent. Understanding [first and second mortgages](/resources/guides/first-and-second-mortgages-for-business) helps businesses evaluate security structures appropriately.

## Lender Selection Strategies

Major banks including Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ, and NAB dominate commercial property lending, offering competitive rates for prime properties and established borrowers. Relationship banking benefits include comprehensive service integration and potential rate discounts for consolidated arrangements.

Regional banks including Bendigo Bank and Bank of Queensland provide alternative options with flexible assessment approaches and personalised service. Decision-making processes often involve localised authority and faster turnaround than major banks navigating complex approval hierarchies.

Specialist non-bank lenders fill market gaps where bank lending criteria prove restrictive, charging interest premiums of 1-3% above bank rates but offering flexible assessment for complex properties or developing businesses. For very urgent property financing needs, [caveat loans](/resources/guides/caveat-loans-australia-complete-guide) offer rapid funding solutions.

## Common Challenges and Solutions

Serviceability shortfalls represent the most common decline reason, addressable through larger deposits reducing loan amounts, interest-only structures minimising payments, or joint borrower arrangements bringing additional income sources. Alternative lender assessment methodologies may provide approval where mainstream calculations prove restrictive.

Property valuations below purchase prices create funding gaps requiring additional deposit contributions or price renegotiations. Obtaining independent pre-purchase valuations helps identify potential issues before contract commitment, while alternative lenders may apply different valuation methodologies.

Complex ownership structures including trusts and partnerships require careful consideration of lending entities and security arrangements. Some lenders restrict trust lending or apply additional requirements including corporate trustees, with professional legal advice ensuring appropriate structure selection. Complex acquisitions may benefit from [business acquisition finance](/resources/guides/business-acquisition-finance-australia) products designed for corporate transactions.

## Tax Considerations

Commercial property loan interest is typically tax deductible for investment properties and business premises, reducing effective borrowing costs by the business tax rate. A business paying 30% tax on a 6% loan effectively pays 4.2% after-tax interest cost.

Loan establishment fees and borrowing costs may be immediately deductible or require capitalisation depending on amounts and regulations. Legal fees and valuation costs associated with property acquisition typically form part of property cost base rather than immediate deductions.

Building depreciation provides annual tax deductions at 2.5% annually for qualifying buildings, with quantity surveyor reports identifying maximum claims. Plant and equipment depreciation covers items including air conditioning and security systems, typically at higher rates than building depreciation.

**While this guide provides general information, businesses should obtain professional tax advice for their specific circumstances.**

## Strategic Considerations

Financial preparation should begin 6-12 months before property purchase, including deposit accumulation, business profit optimisation, and financial documentation preparation. Demonstrating consistent financial performance substantially improves lending prospects and negotiating power.

Market research should consider not only operational suitability but also lender appetite and financing feasibility. Properties with strong tenant covenants, mainstream uses, and prime locations consistently achieve better financing terms than specialty properties.

Professional advisor engagement including commercial finance brokers, lawyers, and accountants provides expertise navigating complex lending markets. Quality professional advice typically generates returns through better loan terms, faster approvals, and strategic structure optimisation.

Regular loan reviews every 2-3 years ensure continued market competitiveness, particularly in changing rate environments. Established owners should proactively assess refinancing opportunities rather than accepting existing arrangements, with professional guidance identifying optimal timing based on market conditions and business circumstances.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What deposit do I need for a commercial property loan?

Commercial property loans typically require deposits of 30-40% of purchase price plus additional funds for stamp duty, legal fees, and due diligence costs. Total cash requirements generally reach 35-45% of property purchase price. Premium properties may achieve 75-80% LVR with select lenders, reducing deposit requirements but typically involving higher interest rates.

### How long does commercial property loan approval take?

Commercial property loan approval typically takes 4-8 weeks from application submission to formal approval. Initial assessment occurs within 5-7 business days, with property valuation and comprehensive due diligence requiring additional time. Complex transactions or specialty properties may extend timeframes to 8-12 weeks depending on circumstances.

### What interest rates apply to commercial property loans?

Commercial property loan interest rates currently range 5.5-8.5% per annum depending on property quality, borrower strength, loan-to-value ratio, and lender type. Major banks typically offer the most competitive rates for prime properties, while specialist lenders charge higher rates reflecting increased risk or flexible lending criteria.

### Can start-up businesses get commercial property loans?

Start-up businesses face significant challenges securing commercial property finance due to limited trading history. Most lenders require 2-3 years of financial statements demonstrating profitable operations. Start-ups typically need substantially larger deposits (50%+), strong director financial positions, additional security, or family guarantees to achieve lending approval.

### Do I need a personal guarantee for commercial property loans?

Most commercial property loans require director personal guarantees, particularly for small-to-medium enterprise borrowers. Personal guarantees extend lender recourse to guarantor personal assets beyond secured property holdings. Some lenders accept limited guarantees capping liability at specific amounts for established businesses with strong financial positions.

### What's the difference between owner-occupier and investment property loans?

Owner-occupier loans finance premises for business operations with serviceability assessed on business cash flow. Investment property loans finance properties for rental income with serviceability heavily weighted toward rental cash flows. Owner-occupier loans typically achieve better rates due to reduced vacancy risk and stronger borrower motivation.

### Can I use residential property equity for commercial property deposits?

Yes, residential property equity can support commercial property deposits through various structures including cross-collateralisation or equity release through residential refinancing. However, this approach connects business and personal assets, requiring careful consideration of risk tolerance. Some lenders offer separate second mortgage arrangements preserving independent security positions.

### How is serviceability calculated for commercial property loans?

Lenders calculate debt service coverage ratios by dividing net operating income by total debt service (principal and interest payments), typically requiring minimum ratios of 1.25-1.50 times. For investment properties, lenders discount rental income by 20-30% when calculating serviceability, accounting for vacancy periods and management costs.

## Conclusion

Commercial property loans provide essential financing for Australian businesses acquiring or refinancing business real estate. Success requires comprehensive preparation, realistic expectations about deposit requirements and interest rates, and thorough understanding of lender assessment criteria and documentation requirements.

The diversity of lending options across major banks, regional institutions, and specialist lenders creates opportunities for businesses across different circumstances and property types. While major banks dominate prime property lending with competitive rates, alternative lenders fill critical gaps enabling transactions outside conventional banking criteria.

Interest rate environments, property market conditions, and business circumstances all influence optimal timing and structure selection. Businesses approaching lending strategically—with thorough documentation and professional guidance—substantially improve approval prospects while optimising loan terms and minimising borrowing costs.

Loan structure decisions significantly impact both immediate cash flow requirements and long-term outcomes. Choices between principal and interest versus interest-only repayments, fixed versus variable rates, and various loan terms require careful evaluation of business objectives, risk tolerance, and market outlook.

Understanding security requirements, guarantee implications, and lender assessment methodologies enables informed decision-making about personal risk exposure and transaction structuring. While commercial property investment offers substantial wealth creation potential, appropriate risk management and conservative leverage enhance long-term sustainability.

Professional advice from experienced commercial finance brokers, lawyers, and accountants proves invaluable navigating the complexities of commercial property finance. The investment in quality professional guidance typically generates returns through improved loan terms, faster approvals, and strategic structure optimisation tailored to individual business circumstances.

Real estate investors who've been declined by traditional banks or need faster settlement timeframes increasingly turn to [private lenders](/guides/private-lending-guide) as viable financing alternatives. Private lending has evolved from a last-resort option into a strategic financing tool that sophisticated investors use to capitalise on time-sensitive opportunities, overcome serviceability limitations, or access capital that conventional lenders won't provide.

Private lenders operate outside traditional banking systems, using their own capital or funds from private investors to provide real estate loans. Unlike banks that rely on rigid credit policies and lengthy approval processes, private lenders focus primarily on property value and equity position. This fundamental difference means investors with complex income structures, multiple properties, or recent credit issues can often secure funding that mainstream lenders reject.

The Australian private lending market has grown substantially over the past decade, with numerous established operators providing capital for residential, commercial, and development properties. Interest rates typically range from 9-18% depending on risk profile, with loan terms from 3 months to 3 years. While significantly more expensive than bank rates currently sitting around 6-8%, private lending provides access, speed, and flexibility that justify the premium for many investment scenarios.

Understanding when private lending makes strategic sense—versus when it's simply expensive capital masking underlying problems—separates successful investors from those who accumulate costly debt. This guide examines how private real estate lenders operate, what they assess when evaluating applications, typical rates and terms across different property types, and strategies for using private lending effectively within your investment portfolio.

## How Private Real Estate Lenders Operate

Private lenders assess loan applications fundamentally differently than banks. Where traditional lenders scrutinise your income, employment history, credit score, and existing debts through detailed serviceability calculations, private lenders focus primarily on property value and equity position. A Melbourne investor earning $120,000 annually might struggle to secure bank approval for their seventh investment property due to serviceability constraints, yet easily obtain private lending based purely on the property's $850,000 value and their $400,000 equity position.

This asset-focused approach allows private lenders to move quickly. While bank approvals typically take 4-6 weeks involving extensive documentation and committee decisions, private lenders can provide conditional approval within 48-72 hours and settle within 5-10 business days for straightforward scenarios. A Sydney investor securing a property at auction with 14-day settlement could arrange private lending and complete the purchase, whereas conventional bank finance couldn't meet the timeline.

Private lending funds come from various sources: high-net-worth individuals seeking returns above bank deposits, managed investment schemes pooling multiple investors' capital, family offices deploying wealth into secured property lending, or established private lending companies using their own balance sheets. The funding source affects rates, terms, and flexibility, with individual private lenders often offering more negotiable terms than institutional private lenders bound by investment mandates.

Security positions matter enormously to private lenders. They'll typically lend 60-75% LVR for established properties, though some stretch to 80% for premium assets or experienced investors. The security must be readily saleable—established houses or apartments in metropolitan areas qualify easily, while rural properties, specialised commercial assets, or properties requiring significant work face stricter limits. A Brisbane investor might secure 70% LVR private lending on a standard suburban house but only 55% LVR on a rural farmlet.

Private lenders charge through interest rates and establishment fees, with typical structures including 10-15% annual interest plus 2-3% establishment fees. Some charge monthly line fees if funds are drawn progressively rather than upfront. Exit fees ($500-$2,000) may apply when repaying the loan. On a $500,000 private loan at 12% for 12 months with 2.5% establishment, total costs reach approximately $72,500—substantially higher than bank lending but acceptable when the alternative is missing an investment opportunity entirely.

## Types of Private Lenders and Their Specialisations

Individual private lenders are high-net-worth individuals who directly lend their personal capital to property investors. Rates typically range from 9-14% depending on relationship, security quality, and loan size. Individual private lenders offer maximum flexibility—negotiable terms, creative structuring, and willingness to consider unique scenarios that institutional lenders reject. However, finding reputable individual lenders requires networks, referrals, or broker connections, and their available capital limits loan sizes typically to $500,000-$3 million.

A Perth investor with a strong relationship with an individual private lender might negotiate 10% interest with no establishment fees for a $400,000 loan, saving significantly versus institutional private lenders. The challenge lies in building these relationships and ensuring proper legal documentation protects both parties. Solicitors should review all private lending agreements regardless of how friendly or informal the arrangement seems.

Private lending companies operate as businesses specifically established to provide property loans. Companies like Balmain, Liberty, and numerous smaller operators maintain professional lending operations with standard policies, documented processes, and regulatory compliance. Rates range from 10-16% with establishment fees around 2-3%, and they handle loans from $100,000 to $20 million+ depending on the company's scale and focus.

These companies provide consistency and reliability that individual lenders can't always match. A Melbourne investor can confidently apply to Balmain knowing their policies, typical turnaround times, and likely terms based on their scenario. Private lending companies also manage larger loan amounts and multiple simultaneous loans across your portfolio, which individual lenders often cannot accommodate.

Mortgage funds and managed investment schemes pool capital from multiple investors and deploy it through property loans. These funds operate under specific investment mandates that define acceptable LVRs, property types, loan sizes, and risk profiles. Rates typically range from 11-15% with establishment fees around 2-3%, and they handle loans from $200,000 upward depending on the fund's size and strategy.

Mortgage funds provide substantial capital pools, making them suitable for larger investment acquisitions or [commercial property loans](/guides/commercial-property-finance-guide) that individual lenders couldn't fund. However, their investment mandates create less flexibility than individual lenders or private lending companies. A Sydney investor seeking $5 million for a commercial property acquisition would naturally look toward mortgage funds rather than individual lenders.

Credit unions and smaller banks sometimes offer products that bridge traditional and private lending, providing faster approvals and more flexible serviceability than major banks while maintaining lower rates than pure private lenders. These hybrid options suit investors who don't quite fit mainstream lending boxes but don't need true private lending's speed or flexibility. Rates might range from 8-11%, sitting between bank and private lending pricing.

Family and friends represent the most accessible private lending source for many investors, though mixing personal relationships with business financing creates unique challenges. Clear legal documentation, formal loan agreements, and regular communication about loan status protect relationships when financial arrangements are involved. A Brisbane investor borrowing $250,000 from parents should engage solicitors to document terms, interest rates, security arrangements, and repayment schedules as formally as they would with institutional lenders.

## When Private Lending Makes Strategic Sense

Time-critical opportunities represent the classic private lending scenario. When you've secured a property at auction with 30-day settlement, found an off-market deal requiring 14-day settlement, or identified a distressed sale needing immediate action, private lending's speed justifies its cost. A Melbourne investor might pay 13% for 6 months on a $600,000 property purchased below market value, spending $39,000 in interest and fees to secure a property worth $680,000—the premium for speed generates net benefit.

The key is ensuring genuine time pressure exists. If the vendor will accept 60-day settlement allowing conventional bank finance, paying private lending premiums wastes money. However, when opportunities truly require immediate action and you have clear refinancing plans to transition to conventional lending within 6-12 months, private lending enables deals that couldn't otherwise proceed.

Serviceability constraints where your income cannot support additional bank lending but your equity position is strong make private lending particularly effective. Investors with multiple properties generating positive cash flow often face this scenario—the properties service themselves successfully, but bank serviceability calculations won't approve further lending. A Sydney investor with eight properties might have $2 million equity across their portfolio but cannot obtain conventional approval for property nine due to serviceability limits.

Private lending ignoring income and focusing on equity allows portfolio expansion that conventional metrics prevent. The investor might secure $500,000 private lending at 12% against one of their existing properties, use those funds to purchase property nine, then refinance the private loan to conventional lending once the new property has tenancy established and rental income proven.

Complex income structures including self-employment, business ownership, overseas income, or irregular earnings often create conventional lending challenges. Banks require consistent, verifiable income over 2+ years with full financials. Private lenders don't care whether you're PAYG, self-employed, or have no Australian income—they focus on security value. A Perth business owner with substantial wealth but complex company structures might find private lending far more accessible than bank finance requiring comprehensive business financials.

Credit impairments such as defaults, judgments, or bankruptcies typically disqualify conventional lending for 2-7 years depending on severity. Private lenders view these historical events as largely irrelevant if your current security position is strong. An Adelaide investor who went through bankruptcy three years ago but has rebuilt $600,000 equity in their home might secure private lending for their next investment property despite conventional lenders declining for another 4+ years.

Renovation and value-add strategies often struggle with conventional lending because banks value properties conservatively in their current condition. Private lenders more readily recognise post-renovation value, particularly when you provide detailed renovation plans and costings. A Brisbane investor purchasing a $450,000 property requiring $100,000 renovation with post-renovation value of $650,000 might secure private lending to $400,000 (61% of end value) despite banks capping loans at $315,000 (70% of current value).

SMSF property investment can utilise private lending when [SMSF loans](/guides/smsf-property-loans-guide) through traditional channels face delays or complications. Private lenders familiar with SMSF lending structures can provide faster approvals for self-managed super funds purchasing commercial or residential investment properties. The higher interest rates are paid from the SMSF's tax-advantaged environment, somewhat offsetting the cost premium versus conventional SMSF lending.

## Typical Rates, Terms and Costs

Residential investment properties attract the most competitive private lending rates, typically 10-14% for metropolitan houses and units in good condition. LVRs generally max at 70-75%, with loan terms from 6-24 months. A Melbourne investor might secure $420,000 (70% LVR) on a $600,000 investment property at 11.5% for 12 months with 2% establishment fees, totaling approximately $60,300 in total costs over the term.

First mortgage positions (where the private lender holds primary security) receive better rates than second mortgage positions (where they sit behind existing bank lending). First mortgage private loans might attract 10-13%, while second mortgages typically command 13-18% reflecting their subordinate security position and increased risk.

Commercial investment properties face rates around 11-16% with LVRs capped at 60-70% depending on property type and location. Office buildings in CBD locations access better terms than regional warehouses or specialised assets. A Sydney investor securing private lending for a $2 million commercial property might obtain $1.3 million (65% LVR) at 12.5% for 18 months with 2.5% establishment, costing approximately $275,000 total over the term.

Commercial property lending often involves more detailed due diligence than residential, with lenders examining tenancy schedules, lease terms, building conditions, and market rental evidence. This additional assessment may extend approval timeframes to 7-14 days versus 3-5 days for residential properties, though still substantially faster than bank lending.

Development and construction projects represent the highest-risk category for private lenders, attracting rates from 14-18% with stricter LVRs around 55-65% of end value. Development lending includes progress draws as construction advances, with funds released against builder's invoices and quantity surveyor certifications. A Brisbane developer might secure $1.8 million (60% of $3 million end value) at 15% with progress draws through 12-month construction.

Development private lending requires detailed feasibility studies, fixed-price building contracts, and clear exit strategies through sales or refinancing. Lenders want confidence the project will complete successfully and generate sufficient value to repay their loan with margin. Less experienced developers face higher rates or lower LVRs than developers with multiple completed projects.

Interest payment structures vary significantly across private lenders. Some require monthly interest payments, preserving the loan principal at original levels. Others allow interest capitalisation where monthly interest is added to the loan balance—convenient for cash flow but substantially increasing total debt. On a $500,000 loan at 12% interest, capitalisation adds $60,000 over 12 months, increasing your debt to $560,000 versus $500,000 with monthly payments.

Capitalised interest affects your refinancing calculations. If you borrowed $500,000 at 70% LVR and capitalised $60,000 interest, you now owe $560,000 (78% LVR), potentially complicating conventional refinancing. Understanding this dynamic before selecting interest capitalisation prevents surprises when transitioning to bank lending later.

## Transitioning from Private to Traditional Lending

The strategic use of private lending typically involves 6-18 month terms bridging immediate opportunities to conventional refinancing once certain conditions are met. Most investors shouldn't view private lending as permanent financing—the higher costs make it sustainable only as temporary capital while positioning for conventional lending transition.

Refinancing timing should be planned from day one of your private loan. If you're using 12-month private lending, start conventional refinancing discussions at 9 months, allowing time for bank valuations, assessments, and potential issues. Missing your refinancing window could force private loan extensions with additional fees and potentially higher rates, or worse, facing loan maturity without replacement funding secured.

A Perth investor with a $400,000 private loan at 13% should begin bank refinancing conversations at month 9, providing 3 months to complete bank processes before the private loan expires. This timeline buffer accommodates delays in valuations, credit checks, or documentation requirements without creating time pressure or forcing expensive extensions.

Valuation improvements during your private lending period strengthen refinancing prospects. If you purchased at below-market value, completed renovations, or secured quality tenants at strong rental rates, conventional lenders will view your property more favourably than at initial purchase. A Melbourne property purchased for $550,000 via private lending might value at $620,000 after renovation, reducing your LVR from 73% to 65% and facilitating conventional refinancing.

Document all improvements, rental income, and market evidence supporting increased valuations. Banks rely on formal valuations, but providing comparables, rental schedules, and renovation documentation helps valuers justify appropriate assessments. Properties that show value growth and stable income during the private lending period refinance far more easily than stagnant assets.

Credit profile improvements matter for refinancing if your initial private lending was necessitated by credit issues. Making consistent private loan payments, resolving other credit issues, and demonstrating financial stability all improve bank refinancing prospects. An Adelaide investor who used private lending after a default should ensure all other debts are managed perfectly during the private loan term, providing clean credit history when applying for conventional refinancing.

Banks typically require 12-24 months of clean credit before overlooking previous defaults, judgments, or late payments. If your private loan term is 12 months and you maintain perfect credit throughout, you may still need additional time before conventional refinancing becomes available. Understanding these timelines prevents assuming automatic refinancing eligibility just because your private loan term concludes.

Serviceability improvements through property cash flow establishment help conventional refinancing. Many investors use private lending to acquire properties that don't initially meet bank serviceability requirements. Once the property has 6-12 months of rental history at market rates, bank serviceability calculations incorporate that income, potentially enabling refinancing that wasn't possible at purchase.

A Sydney investor using private lending to acquire property seven in their portfolio might initially fail bank serviceability. After 12 months with the property tenanted at $850 weekly rent, that income is included in bank calculations, potentially creating sufficient serviceability for refinancing. The private lending period thus serves as a bridge until the property's income can be recognised by conventional lenders.

## Risk Management and Due Diligence

Legal documentation must be professionally prepared and independently reviewed regardless of how friendly or informal your private lending arrangement seems. Every private loan requires formal loan agreements specifying: principal amount, interest rate and payment terms, loan term and extension provisions, security details and registration, default conditions and remedies, early repayment rights and any associated costs.

Engaging solicitors with property lending experience protects both borrower and lender interests. Costs of $1,500-$3,000 for proper documentation seem significant but pale compared to disputes arising from informal arrangements. A Brisbane investor borrowing from a family friend should insist on formal documentation—protecting the relationship by clarifying expectations and obligations from the outset.

Security registration must occur through appropriate land titles offices, creating legally enforceable charges over your properties. Private lenders will require registered mortgages just like banks. Unregistered lending agreements, while potentially valid contracts, provide weak security positions that complicate enforcement if problems arise. Any legitimate private lender will insist on proper security registration, and you should view reluctance to register as a warning sign.

Insurance requirements should be clearly specified in your loan agreement. Private lenders typically require building insurance with the lender noted as interested party, ensuring the security property is protected. Some also require mortgage insurance or loan protection insurance. A Melbourne investor must maintain adequate insurance throughout their private loan term, with evidence provided to the lender annually or as requested.

Repayment capacity planning before taking private lending prevents financial stress during the loan term. Interest-only private loans at 12-14% require substantially more cash flow than bank loans at 7-8%. On a $500,000 private loan at 13%, monthly interest reaches approximately $5,417 versus $2,917 on an equivalent bank loan. Ensure your cash flow—from employment, business, rental income, or reserves—can comfortably service these higher payments.

Building 3-6 months of interest reserves provides buffer against rental vacancies, unexpected expenses, or income disruptions during your private loan term. A Perth investor with $400,000 private lending at 12% should maintain $14,400-$28,800 in accessible reserves ($4,800 monthly interest × 3-6 months), ensuring payment capacity even if rental income is temporarily interrupted.

Exit strategy clarity ranks among the most critical risk management elements. Before taking any private loan, clearly define how you'll repay it: conventional refinancing after 12 months, property sale before term expiration, or other capital sources. Vague plans like "we'll see what happens" create significant risk of loan maturity with no repayment mechanism, potentially forcing distressed sales or default.

Document your exit strategy in writing and review it quarterly during your private loan term. If circumstances change—property values decline, conventional lending tightens, or your financial situation shifts—you need adequate time to adjust your strategy rather than discovering exit problems weeks before loan maturity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between private lenders and hard money lenders?
The terms are often used interchangeably in Australia, both referring to non-bank lenders who provide property loans based primarily on security value rather than borrower income. "Hard money" originated in the US referring to asset-based lending, while "private lending" emphasises non-bank capital sources. Both typically offer similar rates (10-18%), fast approvals (3-10 days), and security-focused assessment. Some use "hard money" specifically for short-term, higher-rate lending (15-18%) versus "private lending" for slightly longer terms at lower rates (10-14%).

### Can I use private lending for my primary residence purchase?
Yes, though private lenders generally prefer investment properties or commercial assets. Private lending for owner-occupied homes attracts similar rates (10-15%) and LVRs (65-75%) as investment properties. Main scenarios include: fast settlement requirements conventional lenders cannot meet, credit impairments preventing bank approval, or complex income not meeting bank serviceability. Most borrowers should exhaust conventional owner-occupied options before considering private lending given the substantially higher costs, but it serves as viable short-term solution when necessary.

### How do private lenders verify property values for loan amounts?
Private lenders typically engage independent registered valuers to assess property values, just like banks. Valuation costs ($600-$3,000 depending on property type and location) are usually paid by borrowers as part of application costs. Private lenders may also conduct their own property inspections or desktop valuations for smaller loans or properties they know well. The key difference from banks is private lenders often recognise potential value post-renovation or in rising markets more readily than conservative bank valuations focused on current condition.

### What happens if I can't repay my private loan when it matures?
Most private lenders offer extension options for 3-6 months if you're making progress toward refinancing or sale. Extension fees ($500-$2,000) plus potential rate increases apply. If extensions aren't viable or you've exhausted available extensions without securing repayment funds, the lender can exercise their security rights, potentially leading to property sale. This worst-case scenario is why exit strategy planning is crucial before taking private lending. Many lenders prefer working with borrowers to find solutions rather than forcing sales, but they have limited patience if you're not actively pursuing resolution.

### Are interest payments to private lenders tax deductible for investment properties?
Yes, interest paid on loans for investment property purchases is generally tax deductible, regardless of whether the lender is a bank, private lender, or individual. The key is the loan purpose—funds borrowed to purchase, improve, or maintain income-producing properties generate deductible interest. However, establishment fees and other loan costs may need to be deducted over five years rather than immediately. Consult your accountant for specific tax advice based on your circumstances, as tax treatment can vary based on loan structure and your overall financial situation.

### Can I get private lending with no income or employment verification?
Yes, this is one of private lending's key advantages. Private lenders focus on security value and equity position rather than income verification. Investors with substantial property equity but limited verifiable income—retirees living off savings, business owners with complex structures, or overseas earners—can often secure private lending when banks decline. However, you still need ability to service loan repayments somehow. Private lenders want confidence you can make interest payments during the loan term, even if they don't require formal income documentation to prove it.

## Maximising Private Lending Benefits for Your Portfolio

Private lending represents a powerful tool within sophisticated real estate investment strategies when used appropriately. The key is viewing it as temporary, strategic capital that enables opportunities or solves problems conventional lending cannot address, rather than permanent portfolio financing. Successful investors use private lending for 6-18 month periods, always with clear refinancing or exit plans to transition back to conventional lending's lower costs.

The premium paid for private lending—typically 3-7% annually versus bank rates—must be justified by benefits: securing below-market acquisitions, overcoming temporary serviceability constraints, accessing opportunities conventional timelines would miss, or bridging credit issues until conventional approval becomes available. A Melbourne investor spending $40,000 on private lending costs to secure a property worth $100,000 more than purchase price achieves excellent return. The same investor spending $40,000 on private lending for a property they could have purchased with bank finance has wasted capital.

Due diligence on private lenders themselves is crucial. Work with established, reputable operators who use proper legal documentation, register securities appropriately, and operate under regulatory frameworks. Seeking the absolute lowest private lending rate sometimes leads to unprofessional operators with problematic practices. Paying 11% to an established private lending company with strong reputation often proves smarter than paying 9% to an unknown individual with informal arrangements.

Building relationships with multiple private lending sources provides options when opportunities arise. Rather than scrambling to find private lending when you've already secured a property, establish connections with 2-3 private lenders before you need them. Understanding their criteria, typical terms, and likely response to your scenarios allows quick action when time-critical opportunities emerge. Working with experienced finance brokers who specialise in private lending helps identify appropriate lenders for your specific circumstances. Discuss their fee structure upfront—brokers may receive commission from lenders, charge fees directly to clients, or use a combination of both models.

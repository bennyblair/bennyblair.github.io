# Second Mortgage for Business Use: 2nd Mortgage Loan (Australia)

*Tell us your scenario - we'll map lenders and likely structures.*

## 2nd mortgage loan: quick overview

2nd mortgage loan can be quick and effective when it's matched to the right scenario. Here's the nuts and bolts for Australian SMEs and how we run the process end-to-end.

**What is 2nd mortgage loan?** It's a commercial finance solution used by Australian businesses. We arrange and negotiate terms with lenders, then coordinate credit and settlement.

## When to use it (Australian SMEs)

- Time-sensitive transactions (deadlines, settlements, supplier payments)
- Funding tied to a clear exit (sale, refinance, receivables, progress claim)
- Working capital gaps (seasonality, stock build, long debtor terms)
- Where property, invoices, inventory or plant & equipment can support the facility

## Rates, fees & typical terms

| Interest | 1.0%-2.2% per month (risk/priority dependent) |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Term | 3-24 months |
| LVR / Advance | Combined LVR typically â‰¤70%-75% |
| Security | 2nd mortgage over investment/commercial property |
| Typical fees | Establishment 2%-4% + legal/valuation |

These are indicative only and vary by lender, asset quality and exit.

## Eligibility & documents

- ABN & photo ID
- Primary lender statement
- Equity position & valuation
- Purpose & exit
- BAS/financials (if servicing relevant)

## Process & timelines

1. **Initial call & data room**
2. **Term sheet negotiation**
3. **Due diligence & security**
4. **Final docs**
5. **Settlement**

**Case vignette.** NSW wholesaler used *2nd mortgage loan* to raise $780,000. Structure: approx 60% LVR, 3-month term. Indicative terms in 24-48h; settlement in 7 business days. Fees: 3.0% establishment + legals. Security and pricing always depend on the asset and exit.

## How we structure and negotiate with lenders

- Map the lender landscape and shortlist realistic structures
- Negotiate pricing and conditions with credit teams
- Coordinate valuation, legals and settlement
- Keep the facility strictly commercial (no consumer credit)

## Deep dive: credit lens & negotiation levers

- What credit teams weigh up (security quality, verifiable cash flows, exit credibility)
- When second mortgages beat caveats (priority, consent, timing)
- Leveraging valuations and rent rolls to improve pricing
- Negotiation levers: LVR, term, interest prepayment, fees, covenants
- Exit strategies that typically pass credit (sale, refinance, debtor collections)
- Common pitfalls that slow deals (unclear purpose, missing docs, unrealistic exit)

## FAQs

**Is 2nd mortgage loan regulated under NCCP in Australia?**
For business-purpose loans, NCCP consumer credit rules generally do not apply. We arrange commercial finance only.

**How fast can funding be arranged?**
Indicative terms are often achievable in 24-48 hours for straightforward scenarios. Settlement timing depends on security, docs and valuation.

**What security is usually required?**
Commonly 2nd mortgage over investment/commercial property. The exact structure is lender- and asset-dependent.

**What documents should I prepare up front?**
Photo ID, ABN, BAS/financials, bank statements, rates notice/title, plus asset/contract evidence.

**Can this help with ATO/tax or supplier arrears?**
Often yes, provided the exit is clear and security supports the risk.

*Emet Capital acts as a commercial finance broker and does not provide consumer credit. Information is general and for Australian business borrowers.*

- **Property & real estate.** Settlement bridging; Residual stock clearances; Leasing incentives; Fitout costs.

## State-by-state nuances (high level)

- NSW: typical differences in turnaround times, local valuation coverage and lender appetite.
- VIC: typical differences in turnaround times, local valuation coverage and lender appetite.
- QLD: typical differences in turnaround times, local valuation coverage and lender appetite.
- WA: typical differences in turnaround times, local valuation coverage and lender appetite.
- SA: typical differences in turnaround times, local valuation coverage and lender appetite.

## Underwriting lens in practice

- Security layers (1st vs 2nd mortgage, caveat, GSA) and priority/consents
- LVR vs asset quality; lease WALE and income coverage where relevant
- Serviceability vs asset-based assessment; interest-prepaid structures
- Conditions precedent (valuations, QS, titles, insurances) and common waivers
- Covenants and information undertakings that appear in term sheets

## Illustrative cost breakdown (example only)

| Facility size | $750,000 |
|---------------|----------|
| Term | 6 months, interest-only |
| Interest (illustrative) | 1.4% per month, paid monthly or prepaid |
| Establishment | 2.5% + legal/valuation at cost |
| Other | Disbursements, settlement agent, PPSR, title fees |
| Estimated total cost (ex-GST) | Depends on days used; always scenario-specific |

These indicative numbers vary by lender, security quality and the exit plan.

## Alternatives to consider

- Invoice finance for debtor-backed working capital
- Trade finance for supplier deposits and shipping windows
- Equipment finance where the asset holds value
- Refinance of the primary facility (if bank appetite/stability allows)

## Common mistakes that slow deals

- Unclear exit or timeline
- Missing title/rates docs or outdated valuations
- Unverified arrears (ATO, suppliers) that emerge late
- Over-optimistic LVR expectations vs asset quality

## Practical tips to improve pricing and speed

- Start your data room early: photo ID, ABN, bank statements, BAS, rates notice, title search, lease docs and any valuations you have.
- Be explicit on use-of-funds and exit steps with dates; this shortens credit cycles and reduces conditions.
- Ask for two structures: lowest-cost and fastest-settling - you can decide based on deadlines and total cost of funds.
- If there are arrears, provide statements upfront; surprises late in the process add risk margin.

In second mortgages, priority and consent are often the critical path - addressing these upfront saves a week.

For trade and import cycles, matching tenor to shipping and debtor terms keeps working capital stable.

We start by mapping the lender set for your scenario and removing options that don't match your timetable or security profile.

Caveat-backed options can be faster but often dearer; we'll compare the true cash cost across realistic timelines.

Credit teams respond well to clear summaries: who you are, what you need, security available, and how funds are repaid.

Price is only one lever: small tweaks to LVR, term, or interest prepayment can reduce total cost of funds materially.

We'll model a base case and a slower exit case to make sure the structure remains safe.

Short timelines favour lenders with in-house legals and desktop valuations; longer timelines can open sharper pricing.

Where servicing is thin, we'll emphasise asset strength and mitigants rather than push a cash-flow story that won't pass.

# Commercial Bridging Finance: Short Term Property Finance — Costs, Timing, Uses

*Speak with a broker about your options (no consumer credit).*

## Short term property finance: quick overview

Thinking about short term property finance? Below we cover the practical bits—use‑cases, eligibility, typical pricing, timelines—and the way we arrange it with credit teams.

**What is short term property finance?** It's a commercial finance solution used by Australian businesses to access capital quickly against property security. We arrange and negotiate terms with specialized lenders who understand short‑term lending requirements.

## When to use it (Australian businesses)

- Time-sensitive property opportunities requiring quick funding
- Bridging gap between property purchase and long-term financing
- Development projects needing interim funding between stages  
- Working capital backed by commercial or investment property
- Debt consolidation while arranging permanent finance solutions
- Business expansion requiring immediate capital injection

## Rates, fees & typical terms

| Interest | 0.8%–2.0% per month (typically interest-only) |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Term | 3–18 months (extensions often available) |
| LVR | Up to 70% (varies by property type/location) |
| Security | First or second registered mortgage |
| Typical fees | Establishment 1.5%–3.0% + legal/valuation |

*These are indicative only and vary significantly by lender, property type, location and deal specifics.*

## Eligibility & requirements

- ABN and business registration
- Property ownership or contract of sale
- Current property valuation (lender-approved valuer)
- Financial position demonstration and serviceability
- Clear business purpose and exit strategy
- Property insurance and rates compliance

## Process & key steps

1. **Property assessment** and preliminary valuation
2. **Lender selection** based on property type and requirements
3. **Credit application** with supporting documentation
4. **Formal approval** subject to final valuation
5. **Legal documentation** and settlement coordination

**Case example.** Sydney-based property developer needed $1.2M to secure commercial site. 65% LVR, 12-month term at 1.4% per month. Unconditional approval in 3 business days; settlement in 8 business days. Used proceeds to secure property while arranging development finance.

## How we structure and negotiate

- Assess property suitability and optimal loan structure
- Match appropriate lenders to property type and location  
- Negotiate competitive rates and minimize approval conditions
- Structure terms to align with your business cash flow
- Coordinate valuations, legals and settlement timing

## Key considerations for short term property finance

- **Interest costs**: Monthly rates accumulate quickly—factor into business planning
- **Exit strategy**: Lenders require clear repayment plan at application
- **Property location**: Metro properties generally attract better terms than regional
- **Interest payments**: Budget for monthly interest payments or capitalization
- **Settlement timing**: Fast approval doesn't always mean instant settlement

## Industry applications

- **Property development**: Site acquisition and early-stage funding
- **Commercial investment**: Securing properties at auction or off-market
- **Construction**: Progress payment bridging between project stages  
- **Manufacturing**: Equipment purchases secured against premises
- **Import/wholesale**: Inventory funding backed by warehouse property

## Common structures

### First mortgage position
Direct security over property, typically offering lower rates and higher LVRs.

### Second mortgage position  
Behind existing finance, higher rates but preserves current banking relationships.

### Interest-only payments
Monthly interest payments with principal due at maturity. Most common structure.

### Capitalized interest
Interest added to loan balance. Useful when cash flow is tight initially.

## Alternative funding options

- **Bank overdraft**: If existing facility limits permit increase
- **Equipment finance**: For specific asset purchases rather than general funding
- **Invoice finance**: Working capital backed by outstanding invoices  
- **Trade finance**: Import/export specific funding solutions

## FAQs

### How quickly can I get approval?
Typically 24-48 hours for preliminary approval, 3-5 business days for formal approval with all documentation.

### What's the minimum loan amount?
Most lenders have minimums around $100,000-$250,000 for short term property finance.

### Can I use residential property as security?
Generally yes, though commercial/investment properties often attract better terms.

### What if I need to extend the loan term?
Most lenders offer extension options subject to continued serviceability and updated valuations.

### Do I need mortgage insurance?
LMI isn't typically required for commercial short term property finance at reasonable LVRs.

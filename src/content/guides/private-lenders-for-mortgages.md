# Private Mortgage Lenders: When Banks Say No

You've spent weeks gathering documents, filling out applications, and waiting for the bank's decision—only to receive a rejection letter. Whether it's due to credit issues, self-employment income, or the property itself, traditional lenders have walked away. But your financing needs haven't disappeared.

Private lenders for mortgages step in precisely at this moment. These non-bank financiers assess your application through a different lens, focusing primarily on the property's value rather than your credit score or employment status. While they charge higher interest rates—typically between 8% and 15% annually—they can approve your loan within 48 to 72 hours and settle within a week.

This guide explores everything you need to know about private mortgage lending in Australia: how these lenders operate, what they truly cost, who qualifies, and when they make financial sense. We'll examine real scenarios where private lending saves deals that banks won't touch, and reveal the red flags that signal you should walk away.

## Understanding Private Mortgage Lenders in Australia

Private lenders for mortgages operate outside the traditional banking system. They're typically high-net-worth individuals, private equity funds, or specialist lending companies that use their own capital rather than depositor funds to issue loans.

### How Private Lenders Differ from Banks

Banks follow strict lending criteria mandated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). They assess your debt-to-income ratio, credit history, employment stability, and conduct extensive serviceability calculations. A single missed credit card payment from three years ago can derail your application.

Private lenders focus predominantly on the loan-to-value ratio (LVR) and the property's market appeal. They're asking: "If this borrower defaults, can we sell this property quickly and recover our capital?" If you're seeking a loan of $400,000 on a property worth $600,000 (67% LVR), the property itself provides their security.

This fundamental difference explains why private lenders accept applications that banks reject. A self-employed tradesperson with fluctuating income but $200,000 equity in a well-located property becomes an acceptable risk.

### The Legal Framework and Regulation

All private lenders operating in Australia must hold an Australian Credit Licence (ACL) or operate as credit representatives of a licensed entity. This requirement protects borrowers from unscrupulous lenders and ensures responsible lending obligations are met.

However, private lenders accessing sophisticated or wholesale investors may be exempt from some National Consumer Credit Protection Act (NCCP) requirements. Understanding [what is private lending](/resources/guides/what-is-private-lending-australia) and its regulatory framework helps you identify legitimate operators from predatory lenders charging excessive fees.

### Types of Private Lending Structures

Private mortgage lending in Australia typically falls into three categories. First mortgages provide primary financing secured against unencumbered property. [First and second mortgages for business](/resources/guides/first-and-second-mortgages-for-business) serve different purposes—second mortgages sit behind existing first mortgages and carry higher interest rates due to increased risk.

Caveat loans represent short-term emergency funding, often settled within 24 hours but costing 2-4% per month. These ultra-short-term solutions work for bridging gaps of days or weeks, not months or years.

## When Private Lenders Make Financial Sense

Private lenders aren't suitable for everyone. Their higher costs mean they work best for specific situations where speed, flexibility, or unique circumstances justify the premium.

### Time-Sensitive Property Opportunities

You've found an undervalued property at auction requiring unconditional finance within seven days. Banks need three to six weeks for standard approvals. Private lenders can provide a loan approval within 48 hours and settle within five to seven days, letting you secure the property before competitors.

Property developers frequently use private finance to purchase development sites quickly. A Melbourne developer recently used a $1.2 million private loan at 12% annual interest to secure a subdivision opportunity. Within four months, they obtained council approval, refinanced to a bank at 7.5%, and saved the deal that would have sold to another buyer within the auction's 72-hour cooling-off period.

### Complex Income Structures

Traditional banks struggle with self-employed borrowers who minimise tax through legitimate deductions. You might earn $180,000 annually but show only $75,000 taxable income. Banks use the lower figure for serviceability; private lenders assess actual business cashflow.

Company directors drawing minimal salaries while building business equity face similar challenges. One Sydney director with $400,000 equity in her commercial property but only $60,000 declared salary secured a $280,000 private loan for business expansion. The bank declined due to insufficient personal income, but the private lender assessed her company's trading history and property equity.

### Credit History Complications

A single default from a previous business failure three years ago remains on your credit file for five years. Banks automatically decline your application despite your current financial stability. Private lenders examine the circumstances: was it a once-off event or pattern of financial mismanagement?

Recent tax debt or court judgments that you're actively resolving don't automatically disqualify you. A Brisbane investor with a $35,000 tax debt under an active payment plan secured a $500,000 private loan against an investment property worth $850,000. The lender required proof of payment arrangements and factored the debt into the loan structure.

### Property Types Banks Won't Finance

Banks reject certain property types regardless of your financial position. Properties under 50 square metres, serviced apartments with hotel-style management rights, properties in rural areas with limited sales data, or units in buildings with outstanding building defects all trigger automatic declines.

[Commercial property loans in Australia](/resources/guides/commercial-property-loans-australia-complete-guide) through traditional channels require perfect property conditions. Private lenders assess these properties individually. A Perth investor secured $380,000 private funding for a 42-square-metre apartment the banks rejected solely due to size. The property's location in a high-demand entertainment precinct made it easily saleable, satisfying the lender's primary concern.

## What Private Mortgage Lending Actually Costs

Understanding the true cost of private lending requires looking beyond the interest rate headline. Multiple fees and charges compound the overall expense.

### Interest Rates and Market Rates

Private lenders for mortgages typically charge between 8% and 15% per annum, compared to bank rates of 6% to 7.5%. The rate you receive depends on your LVR, loan term, property type, and perceived risk.

A $500,000 loan at 11% annual interest costs $55,000 in interest over 12 months. If you're using this to secure a property you'll refinance within six months, your actual interest cost is $27,500—possibly worthwhile for a time-sensitive opportunity.

Higher LVRs attract premium rates. Borrowing 70% of property value might cost 10%, while 80% LVR could jump to 14%. Each lender prices risk differently, making comparison essential.

### Upfront and Establishment Fees

Expect establishment fees ranging from 1% to 3% of the loan amount. On a $400,000 loan, that's $4,000 to $12,000 payable at settlement. Some lenders charge flat fees instead—typically $2,500 to $5,000 regardless of loan size.

Legal fees for preparing loan documents add $1,500 to $3,000. Valuation fees range from $600 for standard residential properties to $3,000 for commercial or unique properties. Many lenders pass these costs to borrowers rather than absorbing them.

Application fees of $500 to $1,000 are sometimes charged upfront, even before approval. Reputable lenders deduct this from establishment fees if your loan proceeds, but some retain it regardless of outcome.

### Exit Fees and Early Repayment Considerations

Most private loans include exit or discharge fees of $500 to $1,500 when you repay the loan. This covers the lender's administrative costs for preparing discharge documents and removing their mortgage.

Early repayment penalties deserve careful scrutiny. Some lenders charge penalties if you repay within the first three to six months, typically calculated as a percentage of the outstanding balance or several months' interest. A loan with 12% annual interest charging a three-month penalty costs you 3% of your loan amount if you refinance early.

One Adelaide borrower took a $600,000 private loan planning to refinance within three months. The contract included a six-month minimum interest charge. When he refinanced at month four, he still paid the full six months' interest—$36,000 instead of the $24,000 he anticipated. Always read the fine print regarding minimum interest periods.

## The Private Mortgage Application Process

Applying for private finance differs significantly from bank applications. Understanding what lenders require and how they assess applications speeds up your approval.

### Documentation Requirements

Private lenders require less documentation than banks, but what they need must be current and accurate. You'll need government-issued identification (driver's licence or passport), proof of property ownership or contract of sale, and recent rates notice or property valuation.

For income verification, most private lenders don't require tax returns or payslips. They may ask for bank statements showing three to six months of transactions to confirm you can meet loan repayments. Self-employed borrowers provide business bank statements instead.

If you're refinancing existing debt, provide your current loan statement showing the outstanding balance. For purchases, your signed contract of sale is essential. The property valuation—often arranged by the lender—confirms the security value supporting your loan.

### Assessment Timeframes and Approval Speed

Private lender assessment typically takes 24 to 72 hours from complete application submission. "Complete" is crucial—missing documents restart the clock. One Perth borrower received conditional approval within 36 hours but waited another week while she located historical property documents the lender required.

Once approved, settlement schedules depend on property type and legal requirements. Straightforward refinances can settle within three to five business days. Purchases coordinate with standard property settlement timeframes, typically 30 to 60 days, though private lenders can expedite if needed.

Caveat loans—the fastest private lending option—can settle within 24 hours for urgent situations. A Canberra investor needed $150,000 within 48 hours to prevent a commercial property penalty clause. A private lender registered a caveat and released funds in 36 hours, charging 3% monthly interest for the three-week period until formal mortgage documents completed.

### Dealing with Brokers vs Direct Lenders

Working with experienced finance brokers who specialise in private lending often produces better outcomes than approaching lenders directly. Brokers maintain relationships with multiple private lenders, understanding each lender's appetite for different deals.

A broker can present your application to the lender most likely to approve it at competitive rates. They also negotiate on your behalf—reducing establishment fees, requesting rate discounts, or removing unnecessary conditions. Their commission comes from the lender, not from you, making their service typically cost-neutral.

Direct approaches work when you've researched specific lenders and understand their lending criteria. However, a declined direct application may prejudice future applications with that lender, whereas brokers can position your scenario optimally from the start.

## Risks and Red Flags to Watch

Not all private lenders operate ethically. Predatory lending practices, excessive fees, and unrealistic loan structures can trap borrowers in worsening financial positions.

### Identifying Predatory Lending Practices

Predatory lenders target desperate borrowers with urgent needs. Warning signs include lenders pressuring you to sign documents without adequate time to review them, refusing to provide written fee schedules upfront, or discouraging you from seeking independent legal advice.

Excessive fees represent another red flag. While private lending costs more than banks, establishment fees exceeding 4-5% of the loan amount or monthly fees beyond standard interest charges suggest predatory pricing. A Melbourne borrower discovered her $300,000 private loan included $18,000 in establishment fees plus a $1,200 monthly "administration fee" separate from interest—totalling $32,400 in first-year costs beyond the 13% interest rate.

Lenders who refuse to provide a credit guide or fail to hold appropriate licensing shouldn't receive your business. Check the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) register to verify any lender's credentials before proceeding.

### Understanding Default Consequences

Private lenders can enforce security more quickly than banks if you default. Most private loan contracts include acceleration clauses allowing the lender to demand full repayment if you miss even one payment.

Default interest rates—often 5-8% above the standard rate—apply immediately to missed payments. A loan at 12% could jump to 18-20% from your first missed payment, compounding your financial stress.

The ultimate consequence is property possession and sale. Private lenders can initiate legal action within 30 to 60 days of default, compared to the longer timeframes banks typically observe. You could lose property equity you've built over years due to a short-term cashflow problem.

### Unrealistic Loan Structures and Refinancing Traps

Some private loans include balloon payments—large lump sums due at loan maturity. A $500,000 loan might require interest-only payments for 12 months, then a $500,000 balloon payment. If you can't refinance to a bank by then, you'll need another private loan at current rates, which might be higher.

One Gold Coast developer took a $800,000 private development loan with a 24-month interest-only term. He planned to complete construction and refinance within 18 months. Construction delays meant he needed refinancing at month 22, but property values had declined 8%. Banks wouldn't lend at his required LVR, forcing him to accept another private loan at 16% instead of his original 11%—costing an additional $40,000 annually in interest.

Always have a clear exit strategy before signing. How will you repay or refinance this loan? What happens if your exit plan fails?

## Alternatives to Private Mortgage Lenders

Before committing to higher-cost private finance, explore whether other options might suit your situation better.

### Second-Tier and Non-Bank Lenders

Second-tier lenders operate between major banks and private lenders. They're regulated financial institutions offering slightly higher rates (typically 7.5% to 10%) but more flexible lending criteria than big banks.

These lenders accept lower credit scores, higher debt-to-income ratios, and non-standard employment situations. A Brisbane couple with a 580 credit score obtained a $420,000 loan from a second-tier lender at 9.2%—higher than bank rates but substantially less than the 13% private lender quote they received.

Non-bank lenders funded by institutional capital offer similar flexibility. They're not constrained by APRA regulations affecting deposit-taking institutions, allowing more nuanced credit assessment. Processing takes longer than private lenders—typically two to three weeks—but costs significantly less.

### Family Loans and Private Agreements

Borrowing from family members avoids interest charges and fees entirely, but introduces personal relationship risks. Treating family loans professionally protects everyone involved.

Document everything in writing: loan amount, interest rate (even if 0%), repayment schedule, and security arrangements. Register a formal mortgage if borrowing against property—this protects your family member's position if other creditors make claims against you.

Consider market-rate interest despite family relationships. This legitimises the loan for tax purposes and prevents potential family disputes about whether the money was a loan or gift. A formal loan agreement also protects your inheritance position—making clear that funds advanced during someone's lifetime should be considered differently than inheritance distributions.

### Equity Release and Refinancing Options

If you own property with substantial equity, bank refinancing might work despite previous rejections. Banks regularly reassess lending policies, and different banks have different risk appetites.

One Sydney homeowner with $600,000 equity but irregular self-employed income was rejected by two major banks. A specialist mortgage broker presented her application to a smaller regional bank that assessed her actual business revenue rather than just taxable income. She obtained $400,000 at 7.8%—avoiding private lending entirely.

Equity release through reverse mortgages suits older Australians (typically 60-plus) who want to access property equity without making repayments. These products have specific regulations protecting borrowers, including no-negative-equity guarantees ensuring you'll never owe more than your property's value.

## Making the Right Choice for Your Situation

Private lenders for mortgages serve an important role in Australia's finance ecosystem, but they're not appropriate for every situation. Making an informed choice requires honest assessment of your circumstances and objectives.

### Calculating Your True Cost of Capital

Don't just compare interest rates—calculate the total cost of each financing option. A 12-month private loan at 11% with $8,000 establishment fees costs more than a bank loan at 7% with $2,000 fees if you're keeping the loan for several years.

Create a spreadsheet comparing: interest paid over your anticipated loan period, all upfront fees, ongoing monthly fees, exit or discharge fees, and any penalty costs if your plans change. A seemingly cheaper option might cost more once all fees are included.

Consider your exit strategy timing realistically. If you're planning to refinance within six months, can you actually achieve this? Property valuations might not support bank lending, or your credit situation might not improve as quickly as anticipated.

### Professional Advice and Due Diligence

Engage an independent finance broker who works with both bank and private lenders. Their broader perspective helps you make optimal choices rather than defaulting to whichever lender you contact first.

Seek independent legal advice before signing any loan documents. Your conveyancer or property lawyer can review the contract for onerous terms you might have missed. The $500 to $1,000 legal review fee could save you tens of thousands in avoided pitfalls.

Verify any lender's credentials on the ASIC register. Research their company history, read reviews from previous borrowers, and don't hesitate to ask difficult questions about fees, penalties, and processes. Legitimate lenders welcome informed borrowers—predatory lenders avoid scrutiny.

### Questions to Ask Before Signing

Ask your prospective private lender these essential questions before proceeding: What's the total amount I'll repay over the loan term including all fees? What specific circumstances trigger default provisions? Can I make additional repayments without penalty? What happens if I can't refinance when the loan term ends?

Request a worked example showing every cost you'll incur from application to loan discharge. Ask what happens if interest rates increase during your loan term (some private loans have variable rates). Understand whether the lender has any capacity to extend your loan term if your circumstances change.

Finally, ask about the lender's approach if you experience temporary payment difficulty. Some private lenders work constructively with borrowers facing short-term challenges; others move immediately to enforcement. This distinction matters enormously if the unexpected occurs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How quickly can I get approved for a private mortgage loan?

Most private lenders provide conditional approval within 24 to 72 hours of receiving a complete application. Settlement timeframes vary by complexity—straightforward refinances can settle in three to five business days, while property purchases coordinate with standard 30 to 60-day settlement periods. Caveat loans for urgent situations can settle within 24 hours, though these carry higher costs. The key factor is application completeness—missing documents restart the assessment clock. Having your identification, property information, and recent bank statements ready before applying significantly speeds the process.

### What credit score do I need to qualify for private lending?

Private lenders typically don't have minimum credit score requirements like banks do. While they review your credit history, their primary focus is your property's value and the loan-to-value ratio. Borrowers with credit scores below 500, recent defaults, or even current court judgments have obtained private finance when sufficient property equity exists. However, poor credit history may result in higher interest rates, lower LVRs (typically 60-70% rather than 80%), or additional conditions. Some lenders specialise in adverse credit situations while others prefer cleaner credit profiles, making broker expertise valuable for matching your circumstances with appropriate lenders.

### Can I use a private lender for owner-occupied home loans?

Yes, private lenders provide finance for owner-occupied properties, though most private lending occurs for investment properties or commercial purposes. Owner-occupied loans may attract slightly lower rates since primary residence properties typically sell faster if enforcement becomes necessary. However, you'll still pay substantially more than bank rates—expect 9-14% rather than 6-7%. Private lending works well for owner-occupied scenarios where banks decline: purchasing unusual properties, bridging between sale and purchase, or when your employment or credit situation temporarily disqualifies you from bank finance. Many borrowers use private finance for 6-12 months while resolving credit issues, then refinance to a bank.

### What's the maximum loan-to-value ratio private lenders offer?

Most private lenders cap LVRs at 65-75% of property value, though some lenders extend to 80% for strong applications or prime properties. Higher LVRs attract significantly higher interest rates—the difference between 70% and 80% LVR might add 3-5% to your interest rate. First-registered mortgages typically achieve higher LVRs than second mortgages, which might only reach 75-80% combined LVR. The property type matters enormously: standard residential properties in metropolitan areas achieve higher LVRs than rural properties, serviced apartments, or properties with building defects. Your exit strategy also influences LVR—lenders offer higher ratios when you demonstrate clear refinancing capacity within 12 months.

### Are private mortgage lenders regulated in Australia?

Yes, private lenders must hold an Australian Credit Licence (ACL) or act as credit representatives of a licensed entity. They're subject to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act (NCCP), which includes responsible lending obligations. However, lending to sophisticated investors or for business purposes may be exempt from some NCCP provisions. Regulatory oversight doesn't eliminate all risk—lenders can still charge high fees and interest within legal boundaries. Always verify a lender's credentials on the ASIC register before proceeding. Reputable lenders welcome scrutiny and provide detailed fee schedules, credit guides, and written loan terms. If a lender refuses to provide documentation or rushes you through the process, consider this a significant red flag regardless of their licensing status.

### What happens if I can't repay my private loan when it matures?

If you cannot repay or refinance when your private loan term ends, you have several options depending on your circumstances. Many private lenders offer loan extensions for additional fees—typically 1-2% of the loan amount plus continued interest at current rates, which may have increased. You might refinance with another private lender, though this incurs new establishment fees and possibly higher rates. Some lenders offer "rollover" arrangements where your loan continues month-to-month at a higher interest rate until you arrange alternative finance. The worst scenario is forced property sale—if you default and cannot negotiate an extension, the lender can initiate possession proceedings and sell your property to recover their capital. This process typically takes 60-90 days from default, giving you time to explore alternatives, but ultimately results in loss of your property and any equity above the loan amount.

### Should I use a mortgage broker for private lending?

Using an experienced mortgage broker who specialises in private lending typically produces better outcomes than direct approaches. Brokers maintain relationships with multiple private lenders and understand each lender's risk appetite, specialty areas, and pricing structures. They can quickly identify which lenders are most likely to approve your application and negotiate competitive rates and fees on your behalf. Brokers also help structure your application optimally—presenting information in ways that address lenders' primary concerns. Their service is usually free to you since lenders pay their commission. However, ensure your broker genuinely represents multiple lenders rather than steering all clients to one lender who pays higher commissions. Ask upfront which lenders they work with and whether they receive different commission rates from different lenders. Independent, client-focused brokers are invaluable; captive brokers working for specific lender networks offer less value.

## Conclusion

Private lenders for mortgages provide essential financing when traditional banks decline your application. Their asset-based assessment approach, rapid approval processes, and flexibility with complex situations create opportunities that wouldn't otherwise exist. Property investors, business owners, and individuals with unique circumstances have successfully used private lending to achieve outcomes impossible through conventional finance.

However, these benefits come at substantial cost. Interest rates double or triple bank rates, fees multiply, and the consequences of default arrive swiftly. Private lending works best as a short-term solution—a bridge to refinancing, a tool to capture time-sensitive opportunities, or emergency funding when no alternatives exist.

Before proceeding, exhaust other options: second-tier lenders, different bank lenders, family arrangements, or restructuring your plans to work within traditional lending parameters. If private lending remains your best path forward, work with experienced brokers, obtain independent legal advice, and ensure you completely understand every term in your loan contract.

The right private loan can save a profitable deal or provide essential breathing room during financial difficulty. The wrong private loan can compound your problems and cost you property equity you've built over years. Choose carefully, plan your exit strategy thoroughly, and never sign documents you haven't fully understood.

If you're considering private lending and need expert guidance through the process, speak with specialists who understand both the opportunities and the risks involved in these financing structures.

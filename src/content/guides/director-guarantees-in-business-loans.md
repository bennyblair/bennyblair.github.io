# Director Guarantees in Business Loans: What They Mean for Borrowers

## Introduction

When Australian businesses borrow from private lenders, directors are often asked to sign personal guarantees. Known as director guarantees, these commitments extend beyond the company and tie the individual personally to repayment obligations. For many directors, the concept raises concerns about liability, property exposure, and risk to family assets.

This guide explains what director guarantees are, why lenders require them, how they work in practice, and what directors should consider before signing. Information here is general only and not financial or credit advice.

## What Is a Director Guarantee?

A director guarantee is a legally binding commitment by one or more directors of a company to personally repay a business loan if the company defaults.

For private lenders, this provides additional comfort. If the company cannot repay, the lender has recourse to the director's personal assets (e.g., property or savings). This aligns director incentives with the company's obligations.

## Why Lenders Require Guarantees

Private lenders take higher risks than banks by approving facilities quickly and often without full financials. To manage risk, they typically require:

- **Company security**: Mortgage over property or caveat
- **Director guarantees**: Ensuring accountability if the company fails

Guarantees reassure lenders that directors are committed and have "skin in the game."

## How Guarantees Work in Practice

If the company repays the loan as agreed, the guarantee has no effect. However, if the company defaults:

- The lender can pursue the director personally
- Recovery may include personal property or assets
- Legal action can be taken in the director's name

Often, directors' guarantees are supported by personal property securities or mortgages over specific assets.

## Risks for Directors

Signing a guarantee carries real risks:

- **Exposure of personal assets**: Homes, savings, or investments may be targeted
- **Joint guarantees**: In multi-director companies, all may be liable, sometimes jointly and severally
- **Impact on family finances**: Guarantees can extend liability beyond the business
- **Limited control**: Even minority directors may be asked to sign

## How Directors Can Protect Themselves

- **Understand the commitment**: Guarantees are not symbolic â€” they are enforceable
- **Negotiate limits**: Some guarantees can be capped in amount
- **Review with legal advice**: Lawyers can explain scope and consequences
- **Maintain transparency with co-directors**: Ensure all are aware of risks
- **Avoid guarantees if inappropriate**: For example, non-executive directors may resist providing them

## Worked Example

A transport company borrows $500,000 via a second mortgage. The company defaults after six months when a planned refinance fails. The lender enforces the director's guarantee, placing a caveat over the director's personal home to recover the balance.

This scenario illustrates why directors should never treat guarantees as routine paperwork.

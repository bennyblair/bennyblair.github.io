# Second Mortgages in Melbourne: How Businesses Use Them

## Introduction

Melbourne's business landscape is dynamic — from property development in the CBD and Docklands to logistics hubs in Dandenong and manufacturing in the north. Many businesses here encounter funding gaps that traditional banks are too slow or too rigid to solve.

For directors who need fast, property-secured finance, second mortgages are a common solution. This article explores how Melbourne businesses use second mortgages, when they make sense, and what risks to consider. Real-world scenarios and case studies highlight how these loans work in practice.

## Why Melbourne Businesses Turn to Second Mortgages

**High-value property market:** CBD office towers, suburban warehouses, and industrial estates provide strong security.

**Active development pipeline:** Builders and developers often need interim finance.

**SME demand:** Many small-to-medium businesses seek quick liquidity for contracts or expansion.

**Bank limitations:** Tight credit policies make banks slow and selective.

## How Second Mortgages Work in Melbourne

**Position:** Registered behind a first mortgage.

**Security:** Equity in residential, commercial, or industrial property.

**Purpose:** Always business — working capital, tax, construction, bridging.

**Exit:** Defined repayment event such as sale, refinance, or receivable.

## Case Study: Melbourne CBD Investor

**Scenario:** Commercial investor needed $1.2m to complete refurbishment of a CBD office floor.

**Security:** Office building valued at $8m, with $5m first mortgage.

**Loan:** $1.2m second mortgage at 72% combined LVR.

**Outcome:** Renovation completed, property revalued at $10m, refinanced with bank, loan repaid.

## Case Study: Dandenong Manufacturer

**Scenario:** Manufacturer faced $600k ATO debt that risked supplier contracts.

**Security:** Industrial site valued at $4.5m with $2.5m first mortgage.

**Loan:** $700k second mortgage, 65% combined LVR.

**Outcome:** Loan settled in 9 days, debt cleared, refinance completed within 5 months.

## Benefits for Melbourne Borrowers

**Speed:** Loans can settle in under 2 weeks.

**Flexibility:** Funds can be used for a wide range of business purposes.

**Capital release:** Unlock equity without refinancing the entire facility.

**Bridge to bank finance:** Short-term solution while preparing for longer-term debt.

## Risks and Considerations

**Higher pricing:** 1–2% monthly interest.

**Exit dependency:** If sales or contracts are delayed, repayment risk increases.

**Intercreditor deed:** May be required, adding time.

**Over-leverage:** Combining loans can reduce resilience if markets soften.

## Practical Checklist for Melbourne Borrowers

- Title search and mortgage statement
- Company and director details
- Proof of business purpose
- Exit strategy (contract, sale, refinance evidence)
- Be ready for valuation and legal reviews

## Conclusion

Second mortgages in Melbourne provide a vital tool for businesses that need to act quickly. While they come at a higher cost than bank loans, they enable projects to proceed, contracts to be preserved, and opportunities to be captured. Success depends on conservative LVRs, credible exits, and timely preparation.

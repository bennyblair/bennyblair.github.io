## 1. What is the Secondary Mortgage Market?

The secondary mortgage market refers to the buying and selling of existing mortgage loans and securities, rather than originating new loans. Lenders sell mortgage assets to investors, freeing up capital for new lending and spreading risk.

This market is essential for liquidity, risk management, and innovation in property finance.

For a primer on first and second mortgages, see: [First & Second Mortgages for Business](/services/first-second-mortgages)

## 2. How Secondary Markets Work in Australia

In Australia, secondary mortgage markets operate through:
- **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS):** Pools of loans sold to investors
- **Whole loan sales:** Lenders sell individual loans to other institutions
- **Securitisation:** Packaging loans into tradable financial products

These mechanisms allow lenders to recycle capital, manage risk, and offer more competitive products.

## 3. Key Participants and Structures

- **Originators:** Banks, non-banks, private lenders
- **Investors:** Superannuation funds, insurance companies, asset managers
- **Trustees & Servicers:** Manage loan pools and payments
- **Rating Agencies:** Assess risk and quality of securities

The structure of secondary markets is designed to balance risk, return, and liquidity for all parties.

## 4. The Role of Second Mortgages

Second mortgages are loans secured against property that already has a primary (first) mortgage. They are used for:
- Business capital
- Debt consolidation
- Property investment
- Bridging finance

Second mortgages are riskier for lenders, so they often carry higher rates and stricter criteria. In the secondary market, these loans may be pooled and sold to investors seeking higher returns.

## 5. Mezzanine Finance in the Secondary Market

Mezzanine finance is a hybrid of debt and equity, often used in property development. It sits between senior debt (first mortgage) and equity, providing additional capital at higher risk and return.

Mezzanine loans are attractive to investors in the secondary market due to their yield and structure. They are commonly securitised or sold as part of loan pools.

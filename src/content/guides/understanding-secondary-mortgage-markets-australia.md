The Australian property finance system is a complex ecosystem, and while most borrowers interact only with the "primary" market—where they take out a loan from a bank or broker—there is a vast and critical machinery operating behind the scenes. This is the secondary mortgage market. It is the engine room of liquidity that allows lenders to keep lending, investors to access property debt as an asset class, and the broader financial system to manage risk. Without a functioning secondary market, the flow of credit to Australian homebuyers and businesses would be significantly constrained, leading to higher interest rates and fewer loan options.

Understanding the secondary mortgage market is essential not just for economists, but for sophisticated investors and business owners. It explains why non-bank lenders can offer competitive rates despite not taking deposits, and how global economic shifts impact your local mortgage repayment. Furthermore, the term "secondary market" is often used interchangeably to describe the market for "second mortgages"—a distinct but related sector of private finance. This guide unpacks the layers of the secondary mortgage market in Australia, explaining how it works, who the key players are, and what it means for the availability and cost of credit in the commercial and residential sectors.

## What is the Secondary Mortgage Market?

In its purest financial sense, the secondary mortgage market is where existing mortgages are bought and sold. When you take out a home loan, you are in the primary market. The lender originates the loan and gives you the cash. However, lenders often do not want to hold these loans on their balance sheets for 30 years. They need to recycle their capital so they can lend to the next borrower. To do this, they sell your loan (often bundled with thousands of others) to investors in the secondary market.

This process transforms an illiquid asset (a single mortgage that pays back slowly over time) into a liquid security that can be traded globally. In Australia, this is predominantly done through Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS). By selling these securities to institutional investors like superannuation funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds, lenders replenish their funding lines. This cycle of origination, sale, and replenishment is what keeps the credit taps open.

The secondary market also serves a vital risk management function. By transferring the credit risk of the mortgages to investors, banks and non-banks reduce their exposure to a housing market downturn. This distribution of risk makes the overall banking system more resilient. For the borrower, the process is usually invisible—you continue to pay your lender, but the ultimate owner of your debt may be a pension fund in Canada or an asset manager in London.

## How Securitisation Drives Lending Liquidity

Securitisation is the mechanism that powers the secondary mortgage market. It involves pooling a portfolio of loans—say, $500 million worth of mortgages—and transferring them to a special purpose vehicle (SPV), a separate legal entity. The SPV then issues bonds to investors, backed by the cash flow from the mortgage repayments. These bonds are "tranched" into different risk levels. The top tranche (Class A) gets paid first and is rated AAA, offering the lowest yield but highest safety. Lower tranches (Class B, C, etc.) take the first loss if borrowers default, offering higher yields to compensate for the risk.

This structure is crucial for non-bank lenders. Unlike big banks, non-banks cannot take customer deposits (savings accounts) to fund their loans. They rely almost entirely on the securitisation market (and warehouse facilities provided by major banks) to fund their lending books. When the secondary market is healthy and investors are hungry for Australian RMBS, non-banks can access cheap funding and pass those savings on to borrowers in the form of competitive interest rates.

However, this reliance on capital markets means non-banks are more exposed to global volatility. If global bond yields rise or investor sentiment sours (as happened during the GFC and the early days of COVID-19), funding costs for non-banks can spike, forcing them to raise rates or tighten lending criteria. Thus, the liquidity of the secondary market is a direct barometer of the health and competitiveness of the Australian lending landscape.

## The Role of Non-Bank Lenders and RMBS

Australia has one of the most robust and well-regulated RMBS markets in the world. Since the 1990s, it has been the driving force behind the growth of the non-bank lending sector. Companies like Firstmac, Resimac, and Liberty Financial were built on the back of securitisation. By accessing the secondary market, these lenders introduced competition to the "Big Four" banks, driving innovation in product features and putting downward pressure on margins.

For commercial borrowers, the Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS) market plays a similar, albeit smaller, role. It allows lenders to fund large commercial property portfolios, shopping centres, and office towers. The principles are the same: pooling loans to attract institutional capital. This access to wholesale funding allows non-banks to offer products that banks might avoid, such as low-doc loans for self-employed borrowers or specialist SMSF loans.

The strength of the Australian RMBS sector lies in the low default rates of Australian borrowers. Historically, Australian mortgages have performed exceptionally well, making our securities highly prized by global investors. This strong demand ensures that non-bank lenders remain a permanent and competitive fixture in the market, providing borrowers with genuine alternatives to the major banks.

## Second Mortgages: A Different "Secondary" Market

Confusingly, the term "secondary market" is sometimes used in the private lending space to refer to the market for [Second Mortgages](/services/first-second-mortgages). A second mortgage is a loan secured against a property that already has a primary (first) mortgage. In the event of a default and sale, the first mortgagee gets paid first, and the second mortgagee gets whatever is left. Because of this subordinate position, second mortgages are higher risk and carry higher interest rates.

This market is distinct from the institutional secondary market described above. It is largely the domain of private lenders and specialised finance companies. Business owners often use second mortgages to release equity from a property without disturbing their low-rate first mortgage. For example, if a business owner has a home worth $2 million with a $1 million bank loan, they might take a $500,000 second mortgage to fund a business expansion.

While distinct, these markets interact. Some sophisticated private debt funds will pool second mortgage loans and securitise them, selling the risk to high-yield investors. This "securitisation of private debt" is a growing trend, bringing institutional capital into the private lending space and potentially lowering costs for borrowers over time. It represents the maturing of the private debt sector in Australia.

## Risks and Opportunities for Investors and Borrowers

For investors, the secondary mortgage market offers a way to gain exposure to the Australian property market without buying physical real estate. RMBS offers regular income (yield) and, for the highly-rated tranches, a high degree of safety. However, risks remain. **Prepayment risk** occurs when borrowers pay off their loans early (e.g., refinancing), reducing the interest income for investors. **Credit risk** is the danger of borrower default, though this is usually absorbed by the lower tranches and Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI).

For borrowers, the main risk is the transmission of global volatility. Because non-banks are funded by global markets, a crisis in the US or Europe can lead to rate hikes in Australia, even if the RBA hasn't moved. On the flip side, the opportunity is access. The secondary market enables lenders to fund "non-conforming" loans—borrowers with minor credit impairments or unusual income structures—that banks would reject.

The existence of a deep secondary market ensures that credit is available across the risk spectrum. It allows lenders to specialise. Some lenders focus solely on prime borrowers and sell the loans to pension funds; others focus on specialist lending and sell to high-yield hedge funds. This specialisation means that for almost every borrower profile, there is a lender with a funding line to match.

## Future Trends in Australian Mortgage Trading

The future of the Australian secondary mortgage market is likely to be shaped by technology and the "green" transition. **Blockchain and tokenisation** have the potential to revolutionise how mortgages are traded. Instead of cumbersome paper-based securitisation, loans could be tokenised and traded instantly on a digital ledger, reducing costs and opening the market to retail investors. This could democratise mortgage investing, allowing everyday Australians to buy a "fraction" of a mortgage pool.

**Green RMBS** is another exploding sector. Investors are increasingly demanding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) compliant assets. Lenders are responding by offering "green loans" for energy-efficient homes and bundling them into Green RMBS. These securities often attract a "greenium" (a lower yield), allowing lenders to offer lower interest rates to borrowers with eco-friendly properties. This trend aligns the financial system with Australia's net-zero goals.

Finally, we expect to see the continued growth of the **private debt secondary market**. As private lending becomes more mainstream, the trading of private loan portfolios will increase liquidity in the sector. This will likely lead to more competitive rates for second mortgages and caveat loans, further benefiting business borrowers who rely on these flexible funding solutions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between a primary and secondary mortgage market?
The primary market is where borrowers get loans from lenders. The secondary market is where lenders sell those loans to investors to raise more funds.

### How does the secondary market affect my interest rate?
A liquid secondary market allows non-bank lenders to access cheaper funding, which helps keep interest rates competitive and offers alternatives to the major banks.

### What is an RMBS?
Residential Mortgage-Backed Security (RMBS) is a financial bond backed by the cash flows (repayments) of a pool of home loans. It is the main currency of the secondary market.

### Is a second mortgage part of the secondary market?
Technically, no. A second mortgage is a type of loan in the primary market. However, pools of second mortgages can be sold to investors, entering the secondary market.

### Are non-bank lenders safe?
Yes. Non-bank lenders are regulated by ASIC and the National Credit Code. The fact that they are funded by the secondary market does not make them less safe for borrowers.

### Can I invest in the secondary mortgage market?
Direct investment in RMBS is usually for institutional investors (minimum $500k+). However, retail investors can access it through managed credit funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

## Conclusion

The secondary mortgage market is the invisible backbone of Australian property finance. It connects the local borrower in Sydney or Melbourne with the global capital markets of New York and London. By transforming individual loans into tradable securities, it ensures that money keeps flowing, competition remains fierce, and borrowers have options beyond the big banks.

For business owners and investors, understanding this market provides context to the lending landscape. It explains the pricing of non-bank loans, the availability of credit during economic cycles, and the emerging opportunities in green finance and private debt. As the market evolves with technology and ESG demands, the secondary market will continue to be a critical driver of innovation and liquidity in Australia's financial system.

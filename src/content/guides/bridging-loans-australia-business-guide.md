# Bridging Loans in Australia: How They Work for Businesses

## Introduction

Timing is everything in business. Deals can be lost not because they are unprofitable, but because funding does not arrive when it is needed. This is where bridging loans come in.

In Australia, bridging loans are short-term, property-secured facilities designed to "bridge" a gap until a known cash inflow — such as a property sale, refinance, or receivable — arrives. While banks do offer bridging finance, their timelines and documentation requirements often make them impractical for urgent needs. Private lenders, on the other hand, can approve and settle bridging loans in days.

This guide explains what bridging loans are, how they work, when they make sense, and what risks directors should watch out for. We also cover worked examples, comparisons with caveat loans, FAQs, and a practical checklist to prepare before applying. Information here is general only and not financial or credit advice.

## What Is a Bridging Loan?

A bridging loan is a short-term facility that covers a funding gap until an identified exit event occurs.

Typical scenarios include:
- Purchasing a property before another sale completes
- Covering construction or fit-out costs ahead of receivables
- Paying tax arrears to preserve contracts while refinancing is arranged
- Meeting settlement obligations when timing is tight

The defining feature is the exit strategy — lenders approve bridging loans only if there is a credible, dated event that will repay the loan.

## Key Features of Bridging Loans

- **Short duration**: Usually weeks to a few months, rarely more than a year
- **Exit-driven**: Repayment tied to settlement, sale, or receivable inflows
- **Property-secured**: Registered as first or second mortgages, or sometimes by caveat
- **Capitalised interest**: Payments are often rolled into the balance, avoiding monthly cash flow drag
- **Fast settlement**: Private lenders can move from application to settlement within days if the file is clean

## How Bridging Loans Differ From Bank Loans

| Feature | Private Bridging Loan | Bank Bridging Loan |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Approval speed | Days to weeks | Weeks to months |
| Documentation | KYC, property security, exit evidence | Full financials, tax returns, serviceability tests |
| LVR caps | 65–75% combined typical | 70–80% possible |
| Interest rate | Higher (1–2% per month) | Lower (<10% annually) |
| Repayments | Often capitalised | Usually monthly servicing |
| Flexibility | High | Low |

Private lenders provide speed and flexibility, while banks offer lower cost but slower execution.

## Advantages of Bridging Loans

- **Fast access to capital**: Settlement deadlines can be met without waiting for banks
- **Flexibility**: Facility sizes tailored to equity and exit strength
- **Preserves deals**: Prevents contract breaches or missed opportunities
- **Cash flow preservation**: With capitalised interest, monthly repayments are not required
- **Straightforward process**: Focus on property equity and exit, not complex financials

## Risks and Red Flags

- **Exit uncertainty**: If the sale or refinance is delayed, the balance grows
- **Higher costs**: Pricing reflects risk and short-term nature
- **Over-gearing**: Equity buffers can quickly erode if property values fall
- **Short extensions**: Extensions may be available but at significant fees
- **Documentation gaps**: Delayed valuations or missing paperwork can stall settlement

## Worked Example 1: Property Settlement

A manufacturer agrees to purchase a $2m warehouse, but the sale of its old site settles six weeks later.

- Required bridge: $1m
- Security: First mortgage over the new property
- Term: 2 months
- Interest: Capitalised at 1.25% per month

The bridge allows the company to complete the purchase. When the old site settles, proceeds repay the loan.

## Worked Example 2: Tax Arrears Bridge

A construction company faces a $450k ATO debt due immediately. Without payment, it risks losing contracts.

- Security: Director's investment property with $1.5m equity
- Facility: $450k caveat-backed bridging loan
- Exit: Refinancing into bank term debt after financials updated

By paying the ATO, the company keeps contracts alive and secures time to finalise refinance.

## Alternatives to Bridging Loans

- **Caveat loans**: Faster, smaller, and suited to urgent needs without full registration
- **Invoice finance**: Uses receivables as security, avoiding property reliance
- **Bank overdrafts**: Cheaper but require strong financials
- **Equity injections**: From directors or investors, though slower to arrange

## Checklist: Preparing for a Bridging Loan

- Current title search for the security property
- First mortgage statements (if applicable)
- Evidence of exit (contract of sale, refinance offer, receivable contract)
- KYC and company documents
- Recent BAS and bank statements
- Valuation report or desktop assessment

Having these ready accelerates approval and settlement.

Cashflow can make or break a business. Even profitable companies often struggle when customers take 30, 60, or 90 days to pay invoices. Payroll, suppliers, tax, and rent don't wait — leaving business owners caught in the gap. Invoice finance, sometimes called debtor finance, is a practical tool to unlock working capital from unpaid invoices.

This article explains what invoice finance is, when it makes sense for Australian businesses, how lenders assess eligibility, indicative costs and terms, and common risks. It also includes a real case example and answers frequently asked questions. Everything here is general information only and not financial or credit advice.

## What is Invoice Finance?

Invoice finance allows businesses to access cash tied up in accounts receivable before customers pay. A lender advances a percentage of the invoice value, typically 70%–90%, and the balance (minus fees) is paid when the customer settles.

**Invoice discounting**: The business retains control of debtor collections. Customers often don't know a lender is involved.

**Factoring**: The lender manages debtor collections directly, and customers are notified to pay the financier.

This flexibility allows businesses to choose a structure that fits their customer relationships and operational needs.

## When Invoice Finance Makes Sense

Invoice finance is most effective in industries with long debtor cycles and predictable receivables. Common scenarios include:

- **Seasonal businesses**: Covering costs during low seasons while waiting for peak invoices to be paid.
- **Growth opportunities**: Unlocking cash to buy stock or hire staff when expansion opportunities arise.
- **Managing long debtor terms**: Industries like wholesale, transport, or manufacturing where 60–90 day terms are common.
- **Bridging to bank facilities**: Using invoice finance as an interim tool while negotiating a longer-term facility.

## Eligibility and Requirements

Eligibility is based more on the quality of invoices and customers than the borrower's own balance sheet.

**Key Requirements:**
- Clean, undisputed invoices
- Debtors must be creditworthy (often larger companies, councils, or government)
- ABN and trading history (3–12 months minimum)
- No encumbrances on receivables (check PPSR)

**Required documents:**
- Recent Aged Debtors Ledger
- Sample invoices and contracts
- BAS statements
- Business financials (profit & loss, balance sheet)

## Costs, Terms and Structures

Invoice finance is priced differently to property-backed lending. Costs are typically linked to the risk of the debtor book.

- **Advance rates**: 70%–90% of invoice value
- **Discount rates**: 1%–4% per 30 days outstanding
- **Service fees**: 0.2%–0.5% of invoice value in some facilities
- **Term**: Often ongoing with a rolling ledger; can also be short-term or spot finance

**Example:**
- Invoice: $200,000 due in 60 days
- Advance: $160,000 (80%)
- Fee: 2% per 30 days = $8,000 over 60 days
- Balance paid at settlement: $32,000 (after fees)

## Risks and Red Flags

Invoice finance is powerful but comes with risks:

- **Customer disputes**: If a debtor contests an invoice, funding may be withheld
- **Concentration risk**: Heavy reliance on one major debtor increases exposure
- **Higher cost vs bank overdraft**: Invoice finance is more expensive than traditional bank debt
- **Disclosure risk (factoring)**: Customers may become aware of financing arrangements
- **Overfunding**: Over-estimating debtor reliability can lead to cash shortfalls

## Case Example: Melbourne Wholesaler

A Melbourne wholesale distributor needed $500,000 to import inventory ahead of the Christmas season. Customers were on 90-day terms, leaving the business unable to fund upfront orders.

Through invoice discounting, the wholesaler unlocked $400,000 (80% advance rate) from confirmed purchase orders. The facility allowed them to pay suppliers, meet demand, and record a 25% sales uplift during the period. The facility was cleared within 100 days as customers paid their invoices.

## Alternatives to Invoice Finance

Depending on circumstances, other forms of working capital finance may be better suited:

- **Caveat loans**: Property-secured, fast, short-term
- **Second mortgages**: Larger amounts with equity release, but slower setup
- **Overdrafts or lines of credit**: Bank solutions, often cheaper but harder to qualify
- **Trade finance**: Purpose-built for import/export and supplier deposits

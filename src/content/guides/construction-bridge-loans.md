## When to Use It (Australian SMEs)

- Time-sensitive transactions (deadlines, settlements, supplier payments)
- Funding tied to a clear exit (sale, refinance, receivables, progress claim)
- Working capital gaps (seasonality, stock build, long debtor terms)
- Where property, invoices, inventory or plant & equipment can support the facility
## Rates, Fees & Typical Terms

| Element | Details |
|---------|--------|
| Interest | 0.8%–1.8% per month (interest-only) |
| Term | 1–12 months (extensions possible) |
| LVR / Advance | Up to ~70% 1st mortgage; ~55–65% 2nd (asset/val dependent) |
| Security | 1st/2nd mortgage over investment or commercial property; caveat |
| Typical fees | Establishment 1.5%–3.5% + legal/valuation |

These are indicative only and vary by lender, asset quality and exit.
## Eligibility & Documents

- ABN & photo ID
- Rates notice & title search
- Purpose & exit strategy
- Assets & liabilities
- Leases (if income-supporting)
- Valuation (if required)
## Process & Timelines

1. **Quick scenario triage**
2. **Indicative terms** (often 24–48h)
3. **Docs & valuation** (if needed)
4. **Credit approval**
5. **Settlement & drawdown**

**Case vignette.** NSW wholesaler used *construction bridge loans* to raise $1,200,000. Structure: approx 65% LVR, 6-month term. Indicative terms in 24–48h; settlement in 7 business days. Fees: 2.2% establishment + legals. Security and pricing always depend on the asset and exit.
## How We Structure and Negotiate With Lenders

- Map the lender landscape and shortlist realistic structures
- Negotiate pricing and conditions with credit teams
- Coordinate valuation, legals and settlement
- Keep the facility strictly commercial (no consumer credit)
## Deep Dive: Credit Lens & Negotiation Levers

- What credit teams weigh up (security quality, verifiable cash flows, exit credibility)
- When second mortgages beat caveats (priority, consent, timing)
- Leveraging valuations and rent rolls to improve pricing
- Negotiation levers: LVR, term, interest prepayment, fees, covenants
- Exit strategies that typically pass credit (sale, refinance, debtor collections)
- Common pitfalls that slow deals (unclear purpose, missing docs, unrealistic exit)
## FAQs

**Is construction bridge loans regulated under NCCP in Australia?**
For business-purpose loans, NCCP consumer credit rules generally do not apply. We arrange commercial finance only.

**How fast can funding be arranged?**
Indicative terms are often achievable in 24-48 hours for straightforward scenarios. Settlement timing depends on security, docs and valuation.

**What security is usually required?**
Commonly 1st/2nd mortgage over investment or commercial property; caveat. The exact structure is lender- and asset-dependent.

**What documents should I prepare up front?**
Photo ID, ABN, BAS/financials, bank statements, rates notice/title, plus asset/contract evidence.

**Can this help with ATO/tax or supplier arrears?**
Often yes, provided the exit is clear and security supports the risk.

*Emet Capital acts as a commercial finance broker and does not provide consumer credit. Information is general and for Australian business borrowers.*

## Industry-Specific Scenarios

- **Construction & trades.** Progress claims timing; Retention and variations; Subcontractor payments; Plant & equipment purchases.
- **Wholesale & import.** Long shipping lead times; FX and supplier deposits; Customs and duty windows; Inventory bulges pre-peak.
- **Manufacturing.** Lumpy raw material buys; Production cycles vs debtor terms; Asset-backed lines for machinery; Maintenance shutdowns.
- **Property & real estate.** Settlement bridging; Residual stock clearances; Leasing incentives; Fitout costs.

## Alternatives to Consider

- Invoice finance for debtor-backed working capital
- Trade finance for supplier deposits and shipping windows
- Equipment finance where the asset holds value
- Refinance of the primary facility (if bank appetite/stability allows)

## Common Mistakes That Slow Deals

- Unclear exit or timeline
- Missing title/rates docs or outdated valuations
- Unverified arrears (ATO, suppliers) that emerge late
- Over-optimistic LVR expectations vs asset quality

## Practical Tips to Improve Pricing and Speed

- Start your data room early: photo ID, ABN, bank statements, BAS, rates notice, title search, lease docs and any valuations you have.
- Be explicit on use-of-funds and exit steps with dates; this shortens credit cycles and reduces conditions.
- Ask for two structures: lowest-cost and fastest-settling — you can decide based on deadlines and total cost of funds.
- If there are arrears, provide statements upfront; surprises late in the process add risk margin.

For deals touching multiple properties, priority and consent order matters — we'll position this early to avoid last-minute delays.

In second mortgages, priority and consent are often the critical path — addressing these upfront saves a week.

Price is only one lever: small tweaks to LVR, term, or interest prepayment can reduce total cost of funds materially.

Where servicing is thin, we'll emphasise asset strength and mitigants rather than push a cash-flow story that won't pass.

If there are arrears (ATO or suppliers), we normalise them in the pack, including statements and a plan to clear them on settlement.

We'll draft a simple data room checklist and drive the process so you can keep running the business.

Short timelines favour lenders with in-house legals and desktop valuations; longer timelines can open sharper pricing.

Caveat-backed options can be faster but often dearer; we'll compare the true cash cost across realistic timelines.

For trade and import cycles, matching tenor to shipping and debtor terms keeps working capital stable.

We start by mapping the lender set for your scenario and removing options that don't match your timetable or security profile.

If the exit is a refinance, we'll sanity-check bank appetite and timing so the bridge doesn't overrun.

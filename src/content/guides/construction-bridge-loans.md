## Industry-Specific Scenarios

**Can this help with ATO/tax or supplier arrears?**

Often yes, provided the exit is clear and security supports the risk.- **Construction & trades.** Progress claims timing; Retention and variations; Subcontractor payments; Plant & equipment purchases.

- **Wholesale & import.** Long shipping lead times; FX and supplier deposits; Customs and duty windows; Inventory bulges pre-peak.

*Emet Capital acts as a commercial finance broker and does not provide consumer credit. Information is general and for Australian business borrowers.*- **Manufacturing.** Lumpy raw material buys; Production cycles vs debtor terms; Asset-backed lines for machinery; Maintenance shutdowns.

- **Property & real estate.** Settlement bridging; Residual stock clearances; Leasing incentives; Fitout costs.

## Industry-Specific Scenarios

## Alternatives to Consider

- **Construction & trades.** Progress claims timing; Retention and variations; Subcontractor payments; Plant & equipment purchases.

- **Wholesale & import.** Long shipping lead times; FX and supplier deposits; Customs and duty windows; Inventory bulges pre-peak.- Invoice finance for debtor-backed working capital

- **Manufacturing.** Lumpy raw material buys; Production cycles vs debtor terms; Asset-backed lines for machinery; Maintenance shutdowns.- Trade finance for supplier deposits and shipping windows

- **Property & real estate.** Settlement bridging; Residual stock clearances; Leasing incentives; Fitout costs.- Equipment finance where the asset holds value

- Refinance of the primary facility (if bank appetite/stability allows)

## Alternatives to Consider

## Common Mistakes That Slow Deals

- Invoice finance for debtor-backed working capital

- Trade finance for supplier deposits and shipping windows- Unclear exit or timeline

- Equipment finance where the asset holds value- Missing title/rates docs or outdated valuations

- Refinance of the primary facility (if bank appetite/stability allows)- Unverified arrears (ATO, suppliers) that emerge late

- Over-optimistic LVR expectations vs asset quality

## Common Mistakes That Slow Deals

## Practical Tips to Improve Pricing and Speed

- Unclear exit or timeline

- Missing title/rates docs or outdated valuations- Start your data room early: photo ID, ABN, bank statements, BAS, rates notice, title search, lease docs and any valuations you have.

- Unverified arrears (ATO, suppliers) that emerge late- Be explicit on use-of-funds and exit steps with dates; this shortens credit cycles and reduces conditions.

- Over-optimistic LVR expectations vs asset quality- Ask for two structures: lowest-cost and fastest-settling — you can decide based on deadlines and total cost of funds.

- If there are arrears, provide statements upfront; surprises late in the process add risk margin.

## Practical Tips to Improve Pricing and Speed

For deals touching multiple properties, priority and consent order matters — we'll position this early to avoid last-minute delays.

- Start your data room early: photo ID, ABN, bank statements, BAS, rates notice, title search, lease docs and any valuations you have.

- Be explicit on use-of-funds and exit steps with dates; this shortens credit cycles and reduces conditions.In second mortgages, priority and consent are often the critical path — addressing these upfront saves a week.

- Ask for two structures: lowest-cost and fastest-settling — you can decide based on deadlines and total cost of funds.

- If there are arrears, provide statements upfront; surprises late in the process add risk margin.Price is only one lever: small tweaks to LVR, term, or interest prepayment can reduce total cost of funds materially.



For deals touching multiple properties, priority and consent order matters — we'll position this early to avoid last-minute delays.Where servicing is thin, we'll emphasise asset strength and mitigants rather than push a cash-flow story that won't pass.



In second mortgages, priority and consent are often the critical path — addressing these upfront saves a week.If there are arrears (ATO or suppliers), we normalise them in the pack, including statements and a plan to clear them on settlement.

Where servicing is thin, we'll emphasise asset strength and mitigants rather than push a cash-flow story that won't pass.Short timelines favour lenders with in-house legals and desktop valuations; longer timelines can open sharper pricing.

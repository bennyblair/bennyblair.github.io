In the fast-paced world of business, cash flow is oxygen, and timing is everything. Opportunities to purchase inventory at a discount, acquire a competitor, or bridge a gap in receivables often arise unexpectedly and require immediate action. Conversely, unforeseen challenges like a delayed customer payment or a sudden tax bill can threaten operational stability. In these critical moments, traditional bank finance is often too slow and cumbersome to be of use. This is where short-term private lenders step in, offering fast business finance solutions designed to keep Australian enterprises moving forward.

Short-term private lending is a specialised sector of the finance market that prioritises speed and asset security over historical trading performance. Unlike banks that may take weeks to assess a loan application based on years of tax returns, private lenders can make decisions in hours and fund in days. This agility makes them an invaluable resource for business owners who need capital "yesterday." Whether it is a [caveat loan](/services/caveat-loans), a second mortgage, or a [short-term business loan](/services/private-lending), these facilities provide a bridge to a future liquidity event. This guide explores how short-term private lending works, when to use it, and how to navigate the market to secure the funds you need.

## When to Use Short-Term Private Finance

Short-term private finance is not a replacement for long-term bank debt; rather, it is a strategic tool for specific situations where speed or flexibility is paramount. The most common use case is managing **cash flow gaps**. A business might have a large invoice due from a reliable client in 60 days but needs to pay suppliers today to fulfil the order. A short-term loan bridges this gap, allowing the business to operate smoothly without stalling production.

Another critical scenario is **opportunity cost**. Imagine a competitor goes into liquidation and their stock or equipment is available at a 50% discount, but the sale closes in three days. A bank loan application would take too long, and the opportunity would be lost. A private lender can provide the funds to secure the asset, which can then be sold or used to generate profit that far outweighs the cost of the short-term loan. This "opportunity capital" is a key driver for many growth-focused SMEs.

Finally, private lenders are often the solution for **urgent debt consolidation or tax payments**. If a business has an outstanding ATO debt or a creditor threatening legal action, the immediate threat to the business's solvency is severe. A short-term private loan can pay out these urgent debts, stopping legal action and buying the business time to restructure, refinance, or sell an asset in an orderly manner. In these cases, the cost of the loan is the price of survival and stability.

## How Short-Term Business Loans Work

The mechanics of short-term private business loans differ significantly from standard bank loans. The primary focus for the lender is the **security** provided, usually in the form of real estate. This could be a residential property owned by the director, a commercial premise, or even vacant land. Because the loan is secured, the lender is less concerned with the day-to-day cash flow of the business and more focused on the equity in the asset. This allows for "low-doc" or "no-doc" lending, where extensive financial statements are not required.

Loan terms are typically short, ranging from **1 to 12 months**. The idea is to provide a temporary fix, not a permanent capital structure. Interest rates are higher than bank rates, reflecting the speed and risk, and are often calculated on a monthly basis (e.g., 1% to 2% per month). Repayment structures are also designed for cash flow relief. Instead of monthly principal and interest payments, the interest is often **prepaid** (deducted from the loan amount at settlement) or **capitalised** (added to the end of the loan), meaning there are no monthly repayments to make during the term.

The application process is streamlined. A borrower submits a summary of the loan purpose, the security property details, and the exit strategy. A conditional offer can be issued within hours. Once accepted, a valuation is conducted (often a quick drive-by or desktop valuation), and legal documents are prepared. Settlement can occur in as little as **24 to 72 hours**. This speed is the defining feature of the product and the primary reason borrowers are willing to pay a premium for it.

## Speed vs. Cost: The Trade-Off

The cardinal rule of private lending is that you pay for speed and convenience. Short-term private loans are more expensive than traditional bank finance, with annualised interest rates often sitting between **12% and 24%** (or higher for unsecured or very short-term caveat loans). In addition to the interest rate, there are establishment fees, valuation fees, and legal costs. It is crucial for business owners to view these costs not in isolation, but as a transaction cost relative to the benefit gained.

For example, if a $100,000 loan costs $5,000 in interest and fees for two months, but it allows you to purchase inventory that you sell for a $30,000 profit, the finance cost is justified. The loan facilitated a net gain of $25,000. Similarly, if the loan prevents a winding-up order from the ATO, the cost is negligible compared to the value of keeping the business alive. The key is to ensure that the **Return on Investment (ROI)** of the funds exceeds the cost of capital.

However, this trade-off requires discipline. Using expensive short-term debt for non-revenue-generating activities or to plug a hole in a dying business is a recipe for disaster. Borrowers must be clear-eyed about the purpose of the funds. It is a tool for specific, time-bound problems or opportunities. Experienced finance brokers can help you run the numbers to ensure the cost-benefit analysis stacks up before you commit to the loan.

## Application Requirements for Fast Approval

To achieve the 24-48 hour settlement times that private lenders advertise, the borrower must play their part. While "low-doc" means fewer documents, it does not mean *no* information. To fast-track your approval, have the following ready: a clear **executive summary** of why you need the funds and exactly how and when you will repay them (the exit strategy). This narrative is crucial for the lender to understand the deal quickly.

You will need to provide **details of the security property**, including a recent rates notice and a mortgage statement showing the current debt balance. This allows the lender to calculate the available equity and the Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR). Most private lenders cap their lending at 65-75% LVR. If you have a recent valuation report, provide it, although the lender may still require their own valuer to verify it.

Identification documents for all directors (drivers license and passport) and the trust deed or company constitution are standard AML/KYC requirements. Having these certified and ready to go avoids administrative delays. Finally, while tax returns may not be needed, a snapshot of your **current aged receivables** or a letter from your accountant confirming your solvency can add weight to your application, particularly for larger loan amounts. Being organised signals to the lender that you are a professional operator, increasing their confidence in backing you.

## Common Uses: Cash Flow, Tax, and Opportunities

The versatility of short-term private finance makes it applicable to a wide range of business needs. **Working capital** is the most common use. Seasonal businesses, for instance, might use a short-term loan to stock up before Christmas, repaying the loan from the sales revenue in January. Construction companies often use it to pay subcontractors while waiting for a progress claim to be approved by a developer.

**Tax debt** is another frequent trigger. The ATO can be aggressive in collecting debts, and a Director Penalty Notice (DPN) can put personal assets at risk. A private loan can clear the tax debt immediately, allowing the business to negotiate a payment plan or refinance to a cheaper lender once the tax portal is clear. Lenders are generally comfortable funding tax payouts provided there is a clear path to repayment.

**Business acquisition** is a growing area. If you have the chance to buy out a partner or acquire a competitor, you often need to move fast. Banks can take months to approve acquisition finance, by which time the deal might be gone. A private loan can secure the acquisition, giving you control of the new entity. You can then use the combined cash flow of the expanded business to refinance to a term loan later. This "bridge-to-acquisition" strategy is a powerful way to grow a business rapidly.

## Exiting the Loan: Strategies for Repayment

The "exit strategy" is the most important part of any short-term loan. Since you are not making principal reductions during the term, the full debt must be cleared at the end. The most common exit is **refinancing**. Once the immediate crisis is over or the opportunity has been realised, the business should look to move the debt to a lower-cost lender. For example, after using a private loan to clear tax debt and improve the credit file, the business becomes eligible for a standard bank loan or a near-prime non-bank facility.

**Asset sale** is another standard exit. This could be the sale of the property used as security, or the sale of stock/inventory purchased with the loan funds. For property developers, the exit is often the settlement of the completed units. It is vital that the timeline for the sale aligns with the loan term. If you expect to sell in 6 months, take a 9 or 12-month loan to provide a buffer against market delays.

**Cash flow from operations** can be an exit for smaller loans, but it carries risk. Relying on future profits to pay a lump sum requires high confidence in your revenue forecasts. Lenders will often scrutinise this exit more closely. Whatever the strategy, it must be realistic. A failed exit leads to default interest rates and potential enforcement action. Always have a "Plan B"—such as selling a different asset—if your primary exit strategy fails.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between a caveat loan and a mortgage?
A caveat loan is a fast, short-term loan secured by a "caveat" on the title, which prevents other dealings. A mortgage is a registered interest. Caveat loans are faster to settle but often have higher rates.

### Can I get a business loan with bad credit?
Yes. Private lenders focus on the asset security rather than your credit score. They are often the only option for business owners with defaults or court judgments.

### How much can I borrow?
Loan amounts typically range from $20,000 to $5,000,000+, depending on the value of the security property and the equity available.

### Do I need to own property to get a private business loan?
Generally, yes. Most private lenders require real estate security (residential or commercial) to mitigate the risk. Unsecured private business loans are rare and very expensive.

### What are the fees involved?
Expect an establishment fee (2-4%), valuation fee (at cost), and legal fees. Discuss their fee structure upfront—brokers may receive commission from lenders, charge fees directly to clients, or use a combination of both models.

### Can I repay the loan early?
Most private loans have a minimum term (e.g., 3 months). If you repay after that, you can save on interest, but check the contract for any early repayment fees.

## Conclusion

Short-term private lenders provide a critical safety net and growth engine for Australian businesses. By offering fast, asset-based finance, they allow business owners to navigate cash flow crunches, solve tax issues, and seize fleeting opportunities that traditional banks simply cannot support. While the cost of capital is higher, the speed and certainty of funding often provide a return on investment that far outweighs the expense.

However, these powerful financial tools must be used with care. A clear exit strategy and a disciplined approach to costs are essential to ensure that short-term debt solves a problem rather than creating a new one. By partnering with experienced finance brokers and understanding the mechanics of the private lending market, you can leverage these solutions to build resilience and drive growth in your business.

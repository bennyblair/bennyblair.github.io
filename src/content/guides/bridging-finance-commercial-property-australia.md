# Bridging Finance for Commercial Property Transactions in Australia

Bridging finance plays a critical role for Australian businesses and investors navigating commercial property transactions. It is a short-term, property-secured solution that provides liquidity while waiting for a defined event, such as the sale of an existing asset or completion of a longer-term refinance. This guide explains what bridging finance is, when it makes sense, how lenders assess applications, what it costs, the key risks, and alternatives to consider. The focus is business-purpose only — not consumer or owner-occupied lending.

## What is Bridging Finance?

Bridging finance is a temporary loan designed to "bridge" a timing gap. It allows a borrower to access capital before the arrival of a future cashflow, such as settlement proceeds or bank refinancing.

- Usually secured by commercial or investment property
- Terms range from 1–12 months
- Interest may be prepaid or capitalised

## When to Use Bridging Finance

Bridging finance suits scenarios where:

- A commercial property is being sold but settlement hasn't yet occurred
- A refinance is underway but bank approval will take weeks or months
- A developer needs to complete construction or settle a site purchase while waiting for sales
- Businesses face tax or supplier obligations that must be met ahead of receivables

## Eligibility & Security

- Must be business-purpose only
- Security typically: commercial or investment property
- Combined LVRs generally capped around 65–70%
- Directors' guarantees common
- Lenders prioritise evidence of a clear, dated exit

## Typical Costs & Terms

- **Interest**: 0.9%–2.0% per month, risk-based
- **Fees**: Establishment 2%–3% + legal and valuation
- **Term**: 1–12 months
- **Repayment**: Usually lump sum at exit, not amortising

## Process & Timelines

1. Submit scenario, security details, and exit evidence
2. Indicative terms can be issued within 24–48 hours
3. Valuation and legal work proceed in parallel
4. Settlement may occur in 5–10 business days if documentation is complete

## Risks & Red Flags

### Exit slippage
If sale or refinance takes longer, interest compounds.

### Over-gearing
Thin equity buffers can force distressed exits.

### Legal delays
Priority deeds, caveats, and consents may slow funding.

### Cost creep
Capitalised interest, extensions, and legals can raise total cost.

## Alternatives to Bridging Finance

- **Second mortgage**: Suitable for longer tenor or higher LVRs if equity allows
- **Caveat loans**: Faster but often more expensive
- **Invoice finance**: For businesses with strong receivables
- **Bank refinance**: Lower cost if timing permits

## Illustrative Example

A Melbourne-based importer is settling a $3m warehouse purchase in two weeks but has a contracted sale of another property completing in six weeks. Bridging finance of $1m is secured against both properties at a 65% combined LVR. Interest is capitalised for the two-month term. When the sale settles, the bridge is repaid in full.

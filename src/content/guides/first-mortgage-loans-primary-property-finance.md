# First Mortgage Loans: Understanding Primary Property Finance

When you're securing finance for commercial property, you'll likely encounter the term "[first mortgage](/guides/first-and-second-mortgages-for-business) loan." It's the most common form of property lending in Australia, but understanding how it works—and why it takes priority over other debts—can make a significant difference to your borrowing capacity and interest rate.

A first mortgage loan is a loan secured by a property where the lender holds first priority over the asset. If you default on repayments, that lender gets first claim on sale proceeds before any other creditors. This priority position means lenders typically offer lower interest rates and higher loan amounts compared to [second mortgages](/guides/second-mortgages-for-business-guide) or unsecured finance.

For business owners and property investors, first mortgages represent the foundation of [commercial property](/guides/commercial-property-loans-australia-complete-guide) finance. Whether you're purchasing an office building in Melbourne, a warehouse in Brisbane, or a retail space in Perth, your first mortgage will likely provide 60-70% of the property's value. The security position, loan terms, and interest rates all differ significantly from second-tier lending options.

This guide explains how first mortgage loans work in the Australian commercial property market, what lenders look for when assessing applications, and how they compare to other financing structures. We'll cover everything from loan-to-value ratios to interest rate expectations, helping you determine whether a first mortgage suits your business financing strategy. Emet Capital offers [first and second mortgage solutions](/services/first-second-mortgages) for businesses seeking flexible property-backed finance.

## What Is a First Mortgage Loan?

A first mortgage loan is a debt secured against property where the lender registers their interest as the primary charge. This registration happens through the relevant state or territory's land titles office, creating a legal priority that protects the lender's position. When you take out a first mortgage, that lender's security interest appears before any other financial claims on the property title.

The "first" designation matters because it determines repayment priority if the property is sold or foreclosed. If your business defaults and the property sells for $2 million, the first mortgage lender receives their full amount owed before second mortgage lenders, unsecured creditors, or equity holders receive anything. This superior position allows first mortgage lenders to offer more competitive terms than subordinate debt providers.

In commercial property finance, first mortgages typically cover the primary purchase price or refinancing amount. A Sydney business buying a $3 million warehouse might secure a $2.1 million first mortgage at 7.2% interest, using the property itself as collateral. The lender's security is registered on the title, giving them legal recourse to the asset if repayments aren't met.

Most Australian commercial lenders only provide first mortgage finance. They won't take a secondary position behind another lender because the increased risk doesn't align with their lending policies. This means your first mortgage will usually come from a bank, credit union, or mainstream commercial lender, while [second mortgages](/guides/second-mortgage-lenders-australia-directory) typically involve specialist finance providers or private lenders.

## How First Mortgages Differ from Second Mortgages

The primary difference between first and second mortgages lies in their security position and the risk each lender assumes. A first mortgage holder gets paid first from sale proceeds, while a [second mortgage](/guides/2nd-loan-mortgage-business-capital) lender only receives payment after the first mortgage is fully satisfied. This fundamental distinction creates significant differences in lending terms, interest rates, and loan structures.

Interest rates reflect this risk differential. First mortgage rates for commercial property currently sit between 6.5-8.5% for most borrowers, depending on property type, location, and borrower strength. Second mortgage rates typically range from 9.5-15% or higher because lenders face greater potential loss if the property value drops or the business defaults.

Loan-to-value ratios also differ substantially. First mortgage lenders might advance 65-70% of a commercial property's value, sometimes reaching 80% for premium assets or strong borrowers. Second mortgage lenders typically cap their combined loan-to-value ratio (first mortgage plus second mortgage) at 75-85%, meaning they're lending into whatever equity remains after the first mortgage.

A Brisbane business might secure a $1.8 million first mortgage on a $3 million property at 7.5% interest. If they need additional capital, they could add a $450,000 [second mortgage](/guides/when-second-mortgages-make-financial-sense-smes) at 12% interest, bringing the total lending to $2.25 million (75% LVR). The second mortgage lender accepts higher risk because they're only protected by the remaining $750,000 equity buffer.

Documentation and approval processes also differ. First mortgage applications typically involve comprehensive financial analysis, formal property valuations, and detailed serviceability assessments. Second mortgages often move faster with less documentation, but they compensate for streamlined processes with higher rates and fees. Both loan types serve different purposes in a business's capital structure.

## Typical First Mortgage Loan Terms and Rates

Commercial first mortgage interest rates in Australia currently range from 6.5% to 8.5% for most borrowers, though rates vary based on property type, location, borrower experience, and loan size. A well-established business buying an office building in a major CBD might secure rates around 6.8-7.2%, while a newer business purchasing a regional warehouse could see rates closer to 7.8-8.2%.

Loan-to-value ratios for first mortgages typically max out at 65-70% for most commercial properties. Premium assets in high-demand locations—like retail spaces in established Melbourne shopping districts—might qualify for 75% LVR. Industrial properties, specialised assets, or properties in regional areas often face stricter limits around 60-65% LVR. Your deposit or equity requirement will be 30-40% of the property's value.

Loan terms for commercial first mortgages generally span 5 to 25 years, with many lenders offering terms around 10-15 years. Unlike residential mortgages where 30-year terms are common, commercial lenders prefer shorter timeframes that align with business lifecycles and property market conditions. A Perth business buying a $2.5 million retail property might structure their $1.75 million first mortgage over 15 years at 7.4% interest.

Interest-only periods of 1-5 years are common with commercial first mortgages, allowing businesses to manage cash flow during establishment or growth phases. After the interest-only period ends, loans convert to principal-and-interest repayments. Some borrowers refinance before this conversion, while others transition to full repayments as their business income increases.

Fees typically include application fees ($1,000-$5,000), valuation costs ($2,000-$5,000 depending on property complexity), legal fees for documentation, and ongoing monthly or annual service fees. Lenders may also charge establishment fees around 0.5-1% of the loan amount. These costs add up quickly on larger loans, so factor them into your total borrowing calculations.

## Who Should Consider a First Mortgage Loan?

Business owners purchasing [commercial property](/guides/commercial-property-development-finance) will almost always use a first mortgage as their primary financing tool. If you're buying your first office, warehouse, or retail space, a first mortgage provides the foundational funding that makes the purchase possible. A Brisbane consulting firm buying a $1.2 million office might secure an $840,000 first mortgage (70% LVR), using savings or other assets for the $360,000 deposit.

Established businesses refinancing existing commercial property loans often switch to new first mortgages with better rates or terms. If you've built equity in your property or improved your business's financial position, refinancing your first mortgage could reduce your interest rate by 0.5-1.5%, saving thousands annually. The existing first mortgage is paid out and replaced with a new first mortgage from a different lender.

Property investors expanding their commercial property portfolio will use first mortgages for each new acquisition. Unlike residential lending where servicing calculations across multiple properties can limit borrowing, commercial lending typically assesses each property's income independently. A Sydney investor might hold first mortgages on three separate commercial properties, each secured solely against its respective asset.

Businesses needing maximum borrowing capacity at competitive rates should prioritise first mortgage finance over other options. Since first mortgages offer the lowest commercial property rates and highest LVRs, they provide the most cost-effective funding for substantial property purchases. Second mortgages or alternative finance might fill gaps, but shouldn't replace first mortgage lending where available.

Self-managed super funds buying commercial property for retirement savings commonly use first mortgages, though [SMSF lending](/guides/smsf-loans-for-commercial-property) has specific restrictions. An SMSF might secure a $700,000 first mortgage to purchase a $1 million commercial property, with the property leased back to the business owner's company. These structures require specialist advice but follow first mortgage principles.

## The Application and Approval Process

The first mortgage application process begins with financial documentation that demonstrates your business's ability to service the loan. Lenders typically require two years of financial statements, recent business activity statements, tax returns, and current bank statements showing trading history. A Melbourne business applying for a $1.5 million first mortgage would compile these documents alongside a detailed business plan explaining how the property supports their operations.

Property valuation forms a critical component of first mortgage approval. Lenders engage registered valuers to assess the property's market value, condition, and income potential. The valuation determines the maximum loan amount through the LVR calculation. If a valuer assesses your Adelaide warehouse at $2.8 million but you've contracted to purchase it for $3 million, the lender will base their $1.96 million first mortgage on the lower valuation figure.

Serviceability assessment examines whether your business generates sufficient income to meet loan repayments plus expenses. Lenders apply serviceability buffers, stress-testing repayments at rates 2-3% higher than the actual loan rate. They'll also consider existing debts, operational costs, and industry-specific factors. A construction business with variable cash flow faces stricter serviceability scrutiny than a medical practice with stable rental income.

Security documentation includes the property title search, building inspections, environmental assessments, and insurance requirements. Lenders want confidence that the property is legally sound, structurally adequate, and appropriately insured. They'll also examine any encumbrances, easements, or restrictions that might affect the property's value or their security position.

Approval timeframes for commercial first mortgages typically run 4-8 weeks from complete application to settlement, though complex scenarios can extend longer. Straightforward applications with strong financials and standard properties might receive conditional approval within 2-3 weeks. Working with experienced finance brokers can streamline the process by ensuring applications are properly structured and documented from the outset.

## Key Considerations Before Committing

Exit strategy planning matters significantly with first mortgage loans because commercial property isn't as liquid as residential real estate. Before committing to a 15-year first mortgage on a Perth warehouse, consider how you'll refinance or sell the property if your business circumstances change. Some commercial properties in specialised industries or regional locations can take 12-24 months to sell, which affects your flexibility.

Interest rate structure—fixed versus variable—requires careful thought for commercial first mortgages. Fixed rates provide certainty for budgeting but typically carry break costs if you need to exit early. Variable rates offer flexibility but expose you to rate increases. Many businesses split their first mortgage between fixed and variable portions, balancing certainty and flexibility. A $2 million first mortgage might be 50% fixed at 7.1% for five years, 50% variable starting at 7.4%.

Prepayment restrictions and break costs can be substantial with commercial first mortgages. Unlike residential loans with minimal prepayment limits, commercial loans often have strict conditions around early repayment or refinancing. If you refinance a fixed-rate first mortgage with three years remaining, break costs could reach $50,000-$100,000 on a large loan. Review these terms carefully before signing.

Property income expectations affect serviceability calculations and your ability to maintain repayments. If you're purchasing a tenanted commercial property, factor in vacancy periods, tenant defaults, and market rental movements. A first mortgage serviceability calculation might assume 90% occupancy, but if your Adelaide retail property sits vacant for six months, you'll need other income sources to maintain repayments.

Professional advice from experienced finance brokers, accountants, and lawyers is valuable before committing to a commercial first mortgage. The loan structure, entity ownership, tax implications, and security arrangements all require specialist knowledge. Discuss their fee structure upfront—brokers may receive commission from lenders, charge fees directly to clients, or use a combination of both models. This investment in professional guidance often saves significantly more than it costs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get a first mortgage with limited business trading history?

Securing a first mortgage with less than two years trading history is challenging but possible. Lenders typically want 2+ years of financial statements to assess serviceability, but some will consider newer businesses with strong directors' guarantees, larger deposits (40-50% equity), or businesses in established industries with proven demand. A startup tech company might struggle, while a medical practice run by an experienced GP could succeed despite limited trading history. Alternative lenders and [private funders](/guides/private-lenders-for-mortgages) are more flexible than major banks for newer businesses.

### What happens to my first mortgage if property values drop?

Your first mortgage remains in place regardless of property value changes, and you're still required to meet repayments according to your loan agreement. Lenders can't demand immediate repayment simply because property values decline, provided you maintain scheduled payments. However, falling values could affect refinancing options if your LVR increases beyond acceptable limits. If a Brisbane property drops from $3 million to $2.5 million and your $2.1 million first mortgage remains unchanged, your LVR rises from 70% to 84%, limiting refinancing choices.

### Can I use a first mortgage to purchase property through my SMSF?

Yes, SMSFs can use first mortgages to purchase commercial property under limited recourse borrowing arrangements. The structure requires a bare trust arrangement where the property is held separately from other SMSF assets, and the lender's recourse is limited to the purchased property. SMSF first mortgages typically have lower LVRs (60-70%) and require the property to meet superannuation investment rules. Many businesses lease commercial property from their own SMSF, with the SMSF using a first mortgage to fund the purchase.

### How does refinancing a first mortgage work?

Refinancing involves applying for a new first mortgage with a different lender to pay out your existing first mortgage. The process mirrors obtaining an original first mortgage—the new lender conducts fresh valuations, serviceability assessments, and credit checks. If approved, the new lender pays out your existing first mortgage at settlement, and their security interest replaces the previous lender's position. Refinancing makes sense when you can secure rates 0.5%+ lower, need to access equity, or want different loan terms.

### What's the difference between a first mortgage and a standard business loan?

A first mortgage is specifically secured against property with registered security on the title, while standard business loans might be unsecured or secured against other assets like equipment, vehicles, or receivables. First mortgages offer lower rates (6.5-8.5%) compared to unsecured business loans (9-15%) because the lender's security position is stronger. First mortgages also provide larger loan amounts relative to the asset value and longer repayment terms than typical business loans.

### Can I have multiple first mortgages across different properties?

Yes, you can hold first mortgages on multiple properties simultaneously, with each first mortgage secured solely against its respective property. A Melbourne business might have a $1.2 million first mortgage on their office building and a separate $800,000 first mortgage on a warehouse. Each property has one first mortgage lender with first-priority security over that specific asset. Lenders assess each application independently, though they'll consider your overall debt position when evaluating serviceability.

## Making First Mortgage Loans Work for Your Business

First mortgage loans represent the cornerstone of commercial property finance in Australia, offering businesses the most competitive rates and largest loan amounts available in the property lending market. Understanding how these loans work—from security positions to LVR calculations to interest rate structures—helps you make informed decisions about whether a first mortgage suits your property acquisition or refinancing needs.

The key advantages of first mortgages stem from their priority security position. Lower interest rates, higher borrowing capacity, and longer repayment terms all flow from the lender's first claim on the property. For most businesses purchasing commercial property, a first mortgage will provide 65-70% of the funding requirement, with your equity or other financing sources covering the remaining 30-35%.

Successfully securing a first mortgage requires strong financial documentation, realistic serviceability calculations, and thorough property due diligence. The 4-8 week approval process rewards businesses that prepare comprehensive applications with properly structured entity arrangements and clear business cases. Working with experienced finance brokers can streamline this process while ensuring you access appropriate lender options for your specific property and business situation.

Before committing to a commercial first mortgage, carefully review the loan terms, prepayment restrictions, and interest rate structure. Consider your exit strategy, factor in potential vacancy periods if the property generates rental income, and seek professional advice on the tax and legal implications of your property ownership structure. These considerations help you avoid costly mistakes and structure your first mortgage for long-term success.

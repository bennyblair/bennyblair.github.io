# Second Mortgage for Business Use: 2nd Mortgage Lenders (Australia)

*Tell us your scenario—we'll map lenders and likely structures.*

## 2nd Mortgage Lenders: Quick Overview

Thinking about 2nd mortgage lenders? Below we cover the practical bits—use cases, eligibility, typical pricing, timelines—and the way we arrange it with credit teams.

**What is 2nd mortgage lending?** It's a commercial finance solution used by Australian businesses. We arrange and negotiate terms with lenders, then coordinate credit and settlement.

## When to Use It (Australian SMEs)

- Time-sensitive transactions (deadlines, settlements, supplier payments)
- Funding tied to a clear exit (sale, refinance, receivables, progress claim)
- Working capital gaps (seasonality, stock build, long debtor terms)
- Where property, invoices, inventory or plant & equipment can support the facility

## Rates, Fees & Typical Terms

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Interest | 1.0%–2.2% per month (risk/priority dependent) |
| Term | 3–24 months |
| LVR / Advance | Combined LVR typically ≤70%–75% |
| Security | 2nd mortgage over investment/commercial property |
| Typical fees | Establishment 2%–4% + legal/valuation |

*These are indicative only and vary by lender, asset quality and exit.*

## Eligibility & Documents

- ABN & photo ID
- Primary lender statement
- Equity position & valuation
- Purpose & exit
- BAS/financials (if servicing relevant)

## Process & Timelines

1. **Quick scenario triage**
2. **Indicative terms** (often 24–48h)
3. **Docs & valuation** (if needed)
4. **Credit approval**
5. **Settlement & drawdown**

**Case vignette:** NSW wholesaler used 2nd mortgage lending to raise $450,000. Structure: approx 70% LVR, 6-month term. Indicative terms in 24–48h; settlement in 14 days. Fees: 3.0% establishment + legals. Security and pricing always depend on the asset and exit.

## How We Structure and Negotiate with Lenders

- Map the lender landscape and shortlist realistic structures
- Negotiate pricing and conditions with credit teams
- Coordinate valuation, legals and settlement
- Keep the facility strictly commercial (no consumer credit)

## Deep Dive: Credit Lens & Negotiation Levers

- What credit teams weigh up (security quality, verifiable cash flows, exit credibility)
- When second mortgages beat caveats (priority, consent, timing)
- Leveraging valuations and rent rolls to improve pricing
- Negotiation levers: LVR, term, interest prepayment, fees, covenants
- Exit strategies that typically pass credit (sale, refinance, debtor collections)
- Common pitfalls that slow deals (unclear purpose, missing docs, unrealistic exit)

## Industry-Specific Scenarios

**Construction & trades:** Progress claims timing; Retention and variations; Subcontractor payments; Plant & equipment purchases.

**Wholesale & import:** Long shipping lead times; FX and supplier deposits; Customs and duty windows; Inventory bulges pre-peak.

**Manufacturing:** Lumpy raw material buys; Production cycles vs debtor terms; Asset-backed lines for machinery; Maintenance shutdowns.

**Property & real estate:** Settlement bridging; Residual stock clearances; Leasing incentives; Fitout costs.

## State-by-State Nuances (High Level)

Each state has typical differences in turnaround times, local valuation coverage and lender appetite:

- **NSW:** Well-established lender network with competitive terms
- **VIC:** Strong appetite for commercial property security
- **QLD:** Growing market with diverse lender options
- **WA:** Resource-focused lenders with asset-based expertise
- **SA:** Boutique lenders with flexible structures
- **TAS:** Limited but specialised lender coverage
- **ACT:** Government and commercial property focus
- **NT:** Specialist lenders for resource and commercial sectors

## Underwriting Lens in Practice

- Security layers (1st vs 2nd mortgage, caveat, GSA) and priority/consents
- LVR vs asset quality; lease WALE and income coverage where relevant
- Serviceability vs asset-based assessment; interest-prepaid structures
- Conditions precedent (valuations, QS, titles, insurances) and common waivers
- Covenants and information undertakings that appear in term sheets

## Illustrative Cost Breakdown (Example Only)

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Facility size | $750,000 |
| Term | 6 months, interest-only |
| Interest (illustrative) | 1.4% per month, paid monthly or prepaid |
| Establishment | 2.5% + legal/valuation at cost |
| Other | Disbursements, settlement agent, PPSR, title fees |
| Estimated total cost (ex-GST) | Depends on days used; always scenario-specific |

*These indicative numbers vary by lender, security quality and the exit plan.*

## Alternatives to Consider

- Invoice finance for debtor-backed working capital
- Trade finance for supplier deposits and shipping windows
- Equipment finance where the asset holds value
- Refinance of the primary facility (if bank appetite/stability allows)

## Common Mistakes That Slow Deals

- Unclear exit or timeline
- Missing title/rates docs or outdated valuations
- Unverified arrears (ATO, suppliers) that emerge late
- Over-optimistic LVR expectations vs asset quality

## Practical Tips to Improve Pricing and Speed

- Start your data room early: photo ID, ABN, bank statements, BAS, rates notice, title search, lease docs and any valuations you have
- Be explicit on use-of-funds and exit steps with dates; this shortens credit cycles and reduces conditions
- Ask for two structures: lowest-cost and fastest-settling — you can decide based on deadlines and total cost of funds
- If there are arrears, provide statements upfront; surprises late in the process add risk margin

We'll model a base case and a slower exit case to make sure the structure remains safe. Short timelines favour lenders with in-house legals and desktop valuations; longer timelines can open sharper pricing.

## Conclusion

2nd mortgage lending provides Australian businesses with flexible, asset-backed financing when traditional bank funding isn't available or fast enough. Success depends on clear exit strategies, quality security, and working with experienced brokers who understand the lender landscape.

The key is matching the right lender structure to your specific scenario, timeline and security profile. We start by mapping viable options, then negotiate terms that balance speed, cost and risk.

## FAQs

**Is 2nd mortgage lending regulated under NCCP in Australia?**
For business-purpose loans, NCCP consumer credit rules generally do not apply. We arrange commercial finance only.

**How fast can funding be arranged?**
Indicative terms are often achievable in 24–48 hours for straightforward scenarios. Settlement timing depends on security, docs and valuation.

**What security is usually required?**
Commonly 2nd mortgage over investment/commercial property. The exact structure is lender- and asset-dependent.

**What documents should I prepare up front?**
Photo ID, ABN, BAS/financials, bank statements, rates notice/title, plus asset/contract evidence.

**Can this help with ATO/tax or supplier arrears?**
Often yes, provided the exit is clear and security supports the risk.

**What's the difference between 2nd mortgages and caveat loans?**
2nd mortgages provide stronger security but take longer to establish. Caveats are faster but typically more expensive.

## FAQs

**Is 2nd mortgage lending regulated under NCCP in Australia?**

**How fast can funding be arranged?**
Indicative terms are often achievable in 24–48 hours for straightforward scenarios. Settlement timing depends on security, docs and valuation.

**What security is usually required?**
Commonly 2nd mortgage over investment/commercial property. The exact structure is lender- and asset-dependent.

**What documents should I prepare up front?**

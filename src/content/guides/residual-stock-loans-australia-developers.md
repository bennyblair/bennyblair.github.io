# Residual Stock Loans in Australia: What Developers Need to Know

For property developers in Australia, "residual stock" refers to unsold apartments, townhouses, or houses that remain once a project is completed. While banks often hesitate to fund projects where stock is unsold, private lenders offer residual stock loans to help developers manage debt, refinance, or free up capital for the next project. These loans are secured against the residual units and provide a flexible bridge until sales are realised.

## What Is a Residual Stock Loan?

A residual stock loan is a short-to-medium-term loan secured by the unsold stock of a completed development.

- **Typically secured by multiple apartments/townhouses** in one project
- **Enables repayment of construction finance** or release of equity
- **Treated as a commercial property loan**, not consumer credit

## When Developers Use Residual Stock Loans

**Debt reduction:** Pay out construction facilities still on the books.

**Working capital:** Free equity to fund marketing, leasing incentives, or new projects.

**Project delays:** Manage sales over time without fire-selling stock.

**Refinancing:** Provide stability until bank refinancing or take-out finance is available.

## Eligibility & Security

**Completed project:** The development must be finished and ready for sale/lease.

**Title registration:** Units need to be on separate titles.

**Valuation:** Independent valuation of unsold units required.

**Security:** 1st mortgage over the unsold stock (sometimes 2nd mortgage if primary debt exists).

## Costs, Rates & Terms

**Interest rates:** ~0.8%â€“1.5% per month depending on risk profile.

**LVRs:** 60%â€“70% of valuation across remaining units.

**Fees:** Establishment 2%â€“3% + legal/valuation costs.

**Term:** 6â€“24 months, depending on sales timeline.

## Risks & Considerations

**Sales risk:** If stock takes longer to sell, rollover/refinancing may be required.

**Market cycles:** Falling property prices may reduce equity buffer.

**Exit clarity:** Lenders require clear sales strategy with realistic timelines.

**Carrying costs:** Developers must budget for holding costs (interest, outgoings, incentives).

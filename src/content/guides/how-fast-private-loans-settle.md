# How Fast Can Private Loans Settle? Timelines for Business Funding in Australia

One of the key advantages of private lending over traditional bank finance is speed. When a business needs funds urgently — to meet a settlement deadline, pay an ATO bill, or secure an opportunity — the ability to access capital within days rather than weeks can be decisive.

But not all private loans settle at the same pace. The speed depends on the type of facility, the complexity of the security, and how prepared the borrower is. This guide breaks down settlement timelines for different private lending products, what factors influence speed, and how businesses can accelerate the process.

## Types of Private Loans and Their Timelines

### Caveat Loans: 1-3 Days
Caveat loans are the fastest private lending option. Because they only require lodging a caveat (a legal notice) on the property title rather than registering a full mortgage, they can settle in as little as 24-48 hours.

**Typical process**:
- Day 1: Application and initial assessment
- Day 2: Legal documentation prepared
- Day 3: Caveat lodged and funds released

### Second Mortgages: 1-3 Weeks
Second mortgages take longer because they require full mortgage registration and often need a priority deed from the first mortgagee. The timeline varies significantly based on consent requirements.

**Without priority deed**: 3-7 days
**With priority deed**: 1-3 weeks (depending on first lender responsiveness)

### Bridging Loans: 3-10 Days
Bridging loans sit between caveats and second mortgages for speed. If structured as a first mortgage or caveat, they can settle quickly. If they require intercreditor arrangements, timelines extend.

## Factors That Affect Settlement Speed

### 1. Document Preparation
The biggest factor in settlement speed is how "clean" the borrower's file is. A complete file includes:

- Identification and KYC documents for all directors
- ASIC company extracts and constitutional documents
- Property title and valuation
- Clear evidence of the exit strategy
- Financial information (BAS, bank statements)

### 2. Property Complexity
Simple residential or commercial properties with clear title settle faster than complex structures with cross-collateralisation, caveats, or multiple owners.

### 3. Security Structure
- **First mortgages**: Fastest, as no consent is required
- **Caveats**: Very fast, but limited loan sizes
- **Second mortgages**: Slower due to priority deed requirements

### 4. Legal Reviews
Lenders' solicitors can fast-track if documents are standard, but bespoke structures slow things down.

### 5. Borrower Responsiveness
Quick responses to information requests can shave days off the process.

## How Businesses Can Accelerate Settlement

- **Prepare documents early**: Have ID, company details, bank statements, and property information ready
- **Know your exit**: Provide contracts, receivables, or refinance evidence upfront
- **Engage a broker**: Experienced brokers know which lenders can genuinely deliver on tight timeframes
- **Avoid unrealistic requests**: Asking for millions in 48 hours is rarely credible. Focus on achievable timelines

## Worked Example

A civil engineering company needs $250,000 within a week to secure equipment for a project.

- They approach a broker with a clean file: ASIC extracts, BAS, property title, and receivable evidence
- The lender issues indicative terms the same day
- Legal documents are drafted and signed within 48 hours
- Settlement occurs in 4 business days

By contrast, a bank loan would have taken 6–8 weeks.

## Risks of Rushing Settlement

While speed is valuable, rushing can create risks:

### Insufficient Due Diligence
Missing red flags in the business's financials or property encumbrances.

### Higher Costs
Paying premium fees for urgent turnarounds.

### Weak Exit Planning
Quick loans without credible exits can lead to extensions or defaults.

Directors should balance urgency with caution — moving fast, but not recklessly.

## Conclusion

Private loans can settle far faster than traditional finance — sometimes in just days. Caveat loans are the quickest, while second mortgages take longer due to deed requirements. Businesses that prepare clean files and engage responsive brokers can dramatically shorten settlement timelines. Still, speed should never outweigh careful planning and realistic exits.

## FAQs

**How fast can a caveat loan settle?**

**Can bridging loans settle quickly?**
Yes, often within 3–7 days if exit evidence is strong.

**What slows down settlement most?**
Incomplete documents, unresponsive borrowers, or delays from first mortgagees.

**Are private loans always faster than banks?**
Generally yes, though costs are higher.

**Are these loans for consumers?**
No. They are strictly for business-purpose funding.

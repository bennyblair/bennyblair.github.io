# Second Mortgage for Business in Australia: What It Is and When to Use It

Australian businesses often encounter funding needs that cannot wait for lengthy bank approval processes. Directors may need to finish a project, pay urgent tax arrears, or release capital tied up in property to take advantage of an opportunity. When the business already has a first mortgage on a property, one option to unlock equity quickly is a second mortgage.

A second mortgage is not a replacement for traditional bank finance. It is a short-term, purpose-driven tool that gives a business flexibility when timing is critical and an exit is already in sight. This article explains what a second mortgage is, when it can make sense, what lenders look for, how pricing works, the risks to consider, and alternatives.

## What Is a Second Mortgage for Business?

A second mortgage is a facility secured against property that already has an existing mortgage registered. The second lender takes a subordinated position on title — meaning that if the property is sold, the first lender is repaid in full before the second lender sees a cent.

Because this ranking increases the lender's risk, second mortgages are usually priced higher than first mortgages and offered for shorter terms. They are intended to bridge a specific gap, not to become permanent financing.

For businesses, a second mortgage can unlock property equity quickly. Common uses include: completing fit-outs to trigger rental income, paying GST arrears so a refinance can proceed, or covering working capital until a contracted receivable arrives.

## When Does a Second Mortgage Make Sense?

Second mortgages work best where there is both equity in the property and a dated exit strategy. They are not intended for indefinite use or long-term leverage.

Situations where they can make sense include:

- **Bridging a settlement gap**: when a property is due to settle but funds are required beforehand
- **Project completion**: finishing works that unlock revenue or trigger further drawdowns
- **Tax or regulatory obligations**: paying ATO arrears to avoid penalties and maintain compliance
- **Seasonal working capital**: covering cash flow for stock or payroll ahead of peak trading

In each case, the loan should be linked to an exit — a sale, refinance, or incoming receivable. Without this, the risk of over-gearing rises quickly.

## Eligibility and Security Requirements

Private lenders assess second mortgages differently from banks, but the fundamentals are similar:

- **Combined Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR)**: The total of the first and second mortgages divided by the property value. Most lenders cap this at 65–75%
- **Property quality**: Residential, commercial, or industrial property may all qualify, but stronger locations and asset types improve appetite
- **Borrower profile**: Facilities are usually taken in company names. Directors' guarantees are standard. Basic financial information, BAS, and bank statements are often required
- **Exit evidence**: For sales, lenders want contracts and realistic net proceeds. For refinances, updated financials and indicative offers from banks. For receivables, signed contracts and counterparty details

## Costs, Fees, and Terms

Because of the subordinated position, pricing reflects higher risk. Borrowers should expect:

- Establishment fees of 1–3% of the facility size
- Legal and valuation fees payable by the borrower, typically several thousand dollars
- Interest often between 1–2% per month. Many lenders allow capitalisation, so repayments are not required during the term, but the balance grows
- Terms usually from 3 to 12 months. Longer terms may be available where the exit is credible

## Worked Example

A construction business needs $500,000 for six months to complete a fit-out. The property is worth $2.5m and has a first mortgage of $1.2m.

| **Item** | **Amount** |
|----------|------------|
| Combined LVR | ($1.2m + $0.5m) ÷ $2.5m = 68% (within common limits) |
| Establishment fee (2%) | $10,000 |
| Legal costs | $6,000 |
| Interest (1.5% per month, capitalised) | $45,000 |
| **Total cost of funds** | **≈ $61,000** |

If the works allow the business to trigger $250,000 per year in rental income, the facility may be commercially justified.

## Regional Case Studies

### Melbourne CBD Commercial Investor

**Scenario:** Commercial investor needed $1.2m to complete refurbishment of a CBD office floor.

**Security:** Office building valued at $8m, with $5m first mortgage.

**Loan:** $1.2m second mortgage at 72% combined LVR.

**Outcome:** Renovation completed, property revalued at $10m, refinanced with bank, loan repaid.

### Melbourne Manufacturing Business

**Scenario:** Dandenong manufacturer faced $600k ATO debt that risked supplier contracts.

**Security:** Industrial site valued at $4.5m with $2.5m first mortgage.

**Loan:** $700k second mortgage, 65% combined LVR.

**Outcome:** Loan settled in 9 days, debt cleared, refinance completed within 5 months.

## Process and Timelines

Settlement speed depends on the quality of the borrower's file. A "clean file" includes:

- Identification and KYC documents for all directors
- ASIC company extracts and constitutional documents
- First mortgage statements and payout figures
- Property title and valuation
- Clear evidence of the exit

With this in place, private lenders can issue terms within 24 hours and settle inside a week. If an intercreditor deed is required from the first mortgagee, timelines may stretch to several weeks.

## Risks and Red Flags

Second mortgages are powerful but carry risks:

- **Exit slippage**: delays in settlement or refinance increase costs and risk default
- **Over-gearing**: high combined LVRs leave little buffer against value falls
- **Complex title structures**: cross-collateralised securities or caveats can delay or block settlement
- **Consent issues**: if the first mortgagee refuses to sign an intercreditor deed, the second mortgage cannot proceed

Mitigants include conservative gearing, contingency buffers in timing and costs, and early engagement with the first lender.

## Alternatives to Consider

Second mortgages are not the only option:

- **Caveat loans** provide smaller, faster facilities but are usually short-term
- **Bridging loans** are tied to dated settlements and can be cleaner for certain exits
- **Invoice finance** unlocks working capital from receivables without touching property
- **Equity injections** avoid debt altogether but may dilute ownership

## Conclusion

A second mortgage is a specialist tool for businesses that need short-term capital and have a clear path to repay. It is not cheap, and it is not permanent, but in the right situation it can unlock substantial value. Businesses should only proceed with a well-documented exit plan and, ideally, with advice from a broker experienced in the private lending market.

## FAQs

**What is a second mortgage for business?**
A facility secured behind a first mortgage that provides short-term funding for business purposes, repaid from a defined exit.

**How is it different from a caveat loan?**
A second mortgage is fully registered on title, while a caveat is only a notice of interest. A caveat loan is faster but usually smaller and shorter-term.

**What are typical LVRs?**
Most lenders cap combined LVRs at 65–75%, depending on property type and exit quality.

**How quickly can funds be accessed?**
Private lenders can often settle in under a week with a clean file, but intercreditor requirements may extend timelines.

**Can interest be capitalised?**
Yes, many lenders allow it so businesses are not making monthly repayments. The balance increases, so a buffer should be built into the exit.

**Are these consumer loans?**
No. These facilities are for business purposes only and not for owner-occupied or personal use.

# The Best Bridging Loan Lenders & Finance Companies [2025]

Choosing the right bridging loan lender can mean the difference between securing your property quickly or missing out on time-sensitive opportunities. With dozens of lenders offering [bridging finance](/resources/guides/bridging-finance-australia-complete-property-guide) across Australia, the challenge isn't finding options—it's identifying which lender aligns with your specific situation, timeline, and borrowing capacity.

Bridging loans serve a unique purpose in property finance. They're short-term funding solutions that help you purchase a new property before selling your existing one, cover auction deposits, or complete time-critical renovations. Unlike traditional mortgages that take 4-6 weeks to settle, bridging finance can be approved and funded within 7-14 days when you're working with the right lender. Emet Capital provides [bridging finance solutions](/services/bridging-finance) designed for time-sensitive commercial property transactions.

The Australian bridging loan market has evolved significantly in recent years. Major banks have largely stepped back from this space, leaving specialist lenders and [private funders](/resources/guides/what-is-private-lending-australia) to fill the gap. This shift has created a diverse landscape where rates, LVR limits, and approval criteria vary dramatically. A Melbourne developer might secure bridging finance at 8.9% from one lender, while a Brisbane investor with similar circumstances faces 12.5% rates elsewhere.

This comprehensive guide examines Australia's leading bridging loan lenders for 2025, comparing their rates, approval speeds, LVR limits, and ideal borrower profiles. Whether you're bridging between residential properties, funding [commercial acquisitions](/resources/guides/commercial-property-loans-australia-complete-guide), or managing development projects, understanding your lender options is crucial for making informed financing decisions.

## Understanding the Bridging Loan Market in 2025

Australia's bridging loan market has transformed significantly, with major banks reducing their participation and specialist lenders expanding offerings. The current market divides into three distinct tiers: top-tier specialist lenders offering rates from 8.5-10.5% with LVRs up to 80%, mid-tier lenders providing flexible serviceability at 10-13% with LVRs reaching 75%, and private lenders charging 12-18% but accepting deals traditional lenders decline.

Interest rates have increased throughout 2024-2025, reflecting broader monetary policy settings. Where prime borrowers might have secured bridging finance at 7.5% in 2022, similar scenarios now attract rates around 9-10.5%. This rate environment makes comparing lenders critical—a 2% rate difference on a $1.5 million bridging loan costs $30,000 annually.

Loan sizes vary dramatically by lender. Some specialist lenders focus on $500,000-$5 million deals, while others handle $10 million+ transactions for commercial or development purposes. Approval timeframes have become a key competitive factor, with the fastest specialist lenders providing conditional approval within 48-72 hours and settling within 7-10 days for straightforward scenarios.

## Top-Rated Specialist Bridging Lenders

Bridgit consistently ranks among Australia's strongest bridging loan specialists, offering rates from 8.95-10.95% with LVRs up to 80% for residential bridging. They've built their reputation on 7-10 day settlement timeframes and straightforward serviceability assessments. Their strength lies in residential transactions where borrowers have clear exit strategies through confirmed property sales or refinancing. Bridgit handles loan sizes from $100,000 to $5 million.

LaTrobe Financial brings 65+ years of lending experience, offering rates from 9.25-11.50% with LVRs reaching 75%. They're particularly strong for borrowers who need slightly longer bridging terms—up to 18 months instead of the standard 12—or those with more complex income structures. LaTrobe Financial accepts PAYG, self-employed, and business income. Their approval process typically runs 10-14 days, handling loans from $50,000 to $10 million+.

Bluestone specialises in non-conforming bridging scenarios where borrowers have credit impairments, complex income, or properties that don't meet mainstream criteria. Their rates range from 10.50-13.95% with LVRs typically capped at 70%. Bluestone excels when you're bridging with minor defaults, ATO payment arrangements, or properties in rural locations that other lenders decline. Settlement timeframes run 14-21 days for loans from $50,000 to $3 million.

Pepper Money offers competitive bridging rates from 9.75-12.25% with LVRs up to 75% for borrowers who might not fit traditional lending boxes. They're particularly effective for self-employed borrowers, recent credit events, or situations where rental income forms part of serviceability. Their sophisticated risk assessment looks beyond simple credit scores to evaluate actual repayment capacity. Approval timeframes typically run 7-14 days for loans from $100,000 to $5 million.

## Commercial Bridging Loan Specialists

Qualitas dominates the commercial bridging space, providing loans from $2 million to $50 million+ for commercial property acquisitions, developments, and business purposes. Their rates typically range from 9.50-13.00% depending on deal complexity. Qualitas excels at complex transactions where mainstream lenders struggle—development sites, commercial properties with vacancy, or businesses requiring quick settlements. Settlement timeframes run 14-28 days for most transactions.

MaxCap provides commercial bridging finance from $3 million to $100 million+, focusing on investment-grade commercial properties and development projects. Their rates range from 8.95-12.50% with LVRs reaching 75% for quality assets. MaxCap's strength lies in their speed for large transactions—they've settled $20 million+ deals within 10 business days when documentation is prepared. They prefer borrowers with property development or commercial investment experience.

Thinktank specialises in commercial bridging loans from $1 million to $30 million, with particular strength in the $2-10 million range. Their rates span 9.95-13.50% with LVRs up to 70%, and they're known for pragmatic risk assessment. Approval timeframes run 10-21 days, and Thinktank excels at bridging finance for [business acquisitions](/resources/guides/business-acquisition-finance-australia), commercial property purchases, or development opportunities requiring quick action.

## Private Bridging Loan Providers

Private lenders operate outside traditional banking systems, using their own capital to provide bridging finance. Rates typically range from 12-18% with establishment fees around 2-3%, significantly higher than specialist lenders but with crucial advantages: speed, flexibility, and willingness to consider scenarios no other lender will touch.

Balmain is among Australia's most established private lenders, providing bridging finance from $500,000 to $20 million+ for residential, commercial, and development purposes. Their rates range from 11.95-15.50% with LVRs up to 70%, and they can settle transactions within 5-10 business days. Their ideal scenarios include time-critical auction purchases, borrowers with recent credit defaults, or properties requiring renovation.

Liberty operates as a hybrid between specialist and private lending, offering bridging solutions from $50,000 to $5 million at rates from 11.50-16.00%. They accept more complex scenarios—recent bankruptcies, business income without financials, properties with unusual characteristics—while maintaining structured approval processes. Settlement timeframes run 7-14 days with LVRs reaching 70%.

Shift Capital provides private bridging finance from $300,000 to $5 million, specialising in transactions needing fast settlement. Their rates range from 12.50-17.00% with LVRs typically capped at 65%, and they've built their reputation on 3-7 day settlement timeframes. Their application process is streamlined—property valuation, basic borrower details, and clear exit strategy form the core requirements.

## How to Choose the Right Bridging Lender

Your property type significantly influences which lenders suit your situation. Residential bridging between houses or apartments under $3 million typically works best with specialist lenders like Bridgit, LaTrobe Financial, or Pepper Money where rates are most competitive. Commercial properties, development sites, or mixed-use assets require commercial specialists like Qualitas, MaxCap, or Thinktank who understand these asset classes.

Your timeline determines whether you can use traditional specialists (7-14 days) or need private lenders who settle within 3-7 days. If you're bidding at [auction with 30 days to settle](/resources/guides/commercial-bridging-finance-auction-purchases), you have time for proper specialist lender assessment. If you need 14-day settlement without arranged finance, you're in private lender territory despite the higher rates.

Credit history influences which lenders will consider your application. Clean credit with no defaults opens all options. Minor defaults push you toward flexible specialists like Bluestone or Pepper Money. Serious credit impairments—recent bankruptcies or multiple defaults—mean [private lenders](/resources/guides/private-lenders-for-mortgages) become your primary option.

Exit strategy clarity affects lender interest and rates. Having a signed sale contract on your existing property or confirmed refinance pre-approval positions you strongly with all lenders. Vague plans like "we'll sell eventually" make lenders nervous, potentially increasing rates or reducing LVRs.

## Comparing Rates, Fees, and True Borrowing Costs

Interest rates form just one component of bridging loan costs. A Brisbane borrower comparing 9.5% versus 11.5% on $1 million over 12 months sees $95,000 versus $115,000 in interest—a $20,000 difference. However, other fees can quickly erode this advantage if you're not comparing total costs.

Establishment fees typically range from 0.5-2.0% for specialist lenders and 2-3% for private lenders. On a $2 million loan, this represents $10,000-$60,000. Some lenders advertise competitive interest rates but charge premium establishment fees. Monthly service fees ($50-$200) and line fees (0.1-0.3% monthly) add $600-$2,400+ annually. Legal documentation ($1,500-$5,000) and valuation costs ($600-$5,000) vary by complexity.

Capitalised interest changes calculations significantly. Many bridging loans allow interest capitalisation, where monthly interest is added to the loan balance rather than paid monthly. This preserves cash flow but increases total borrowing. A $1.5 million loan at 10.5% with capitalised interest becomes $1,657,500 after 12 months, compared to $1.5 million if you service interest monthly.

The true cost comparison requires calculating total interest plus all fees across your expected loan term. Working with experienced brokers helps identify these hidden costs and structure your application optimally.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How quickly can I get bridging loan approval and funding?

The fastest specialist lenders provide conditional approval within 48-72 hours and can settle within 7-10 days for straightforward residential scenarios with clear exit strategies. Private lenders sometimes move even faster—3-5 days from application to settlement—but charge premium rates for this speed. Commercial bridging typically takes 14-21 days due to more complex due diligence requirements. Your preparation significantly affects timing; having valuations, contracts, exit strategy documentation, and financial details ready at application accelerates the process considerably.

### What's the maximum LVR I can borrow for bridging finance?

Most specialist lenders cap residential bridging at 75-80% LVR, though this often includes existing debt on the property being sold plus the new bridging loan combined. Commercial bridging typically maxes at 65-75% LVR depending on property type and borrower experience. Private lenders occasionally stretch to 70-75% for exceptional security, but higher LVRs increase rates significantly. The LVR calculation includes all lending across all properties used as security, so combined lending position affects your maximum.

### Can I get bridging finance with bad credit or previous defaults?

Yes, but your options narrow and rates increase. Recent minor defaults might push you from mainstream specialists (9-11%) to flexible specialists like Bluestone (10.5-14%). More serious credit issues—multiple defaults, judgments, or recent bankruptcy—typically require private lenders (12-18%) who focus on security value rather than credit history. The timing of credit issues matters; defaults from 2-3 years ago with clean history since carry less impact than recent problems. Some lenders won't touch credit issues regardless of security strength.

### What happens if my property doesn't sell during the bridging term?

Most bridging loans include provisions for extensions, typically 3-6 months beyond the original term. However, extension fees ($500-$2,000) plus potential rate increases make extensions expensive. If you can't sell or refinance before the bridging loan expires, you risk default, which could lead to the lender exercising their security rights. This risk is why lenders scrutinise exit strategies carefully. Many borrowers refinance to conventional investment loans if their original sale plan doesn't materialise, avoiding default by changing their exit strategy.

### Are bridging loans only for property purchases or can I use them for other purposes?

While purchasing before selling is the classic scenario, bridging loans fund numerous purposes: renovation costs before refinancing, auction deposits, commercial property settlements, business [working capital](/resources/guides/working-capital-loans-for-smes) secured by property, and development costs before [construction finance](/resources/guides/construction-finance-australia-complete-guide). Some lenders offer "closed bridging" where funds must purchase specific property, while others provide "open bridging" for flexible use. Commercial and private lenders are generally more flexible about loan purpose than residential specialists who prefer clear property transactions.

### How do lenders assess exit strategy viability?

Lenders evaluate whether your repayment plan is realistic and achievable within the loan term. The strongest exit strategy is a signed sale contract on your existing property with settlement date confirmed. Next best is formal refinance pre-approval from an end debt lender showing you can service long-term finance. Property valuations showing adequate equity for refinancing or realistic sale timeframe estimates also support your exit case. Vague plans without supporting evidence make lenders nervous, potentially causing declinations or requiring lower LVRs and higher rates.

## Making the Right Lender Choice for Your Bridging Needs

Selecting the right bridging loan lender requires balancing rate competitiveness, approval speed, LVR capacity, and lender specialisation against your specific property scenario and timeline. The "best" lender varies dramatically based on whether you're bridging residential properties worth $800,000 or commercial assets worth $15 million, whether you need settlement in five days or 30, and whether your credit file is pristine or complicated.

For straightforward residential bridging with clear exit strategies and good credit, specialist lenders like Bridgit, LaTrobe Financial, or Pepper Money typically offer the strongest combination of competitive rates (9-11%) and reasonable settlement timeframes (7-14 days). Commercial property transactions require specialist commercial lenders like Qualitas, MaxCap, or Thinktank who understand these asset classes and can structure appropriate facilities.

Private lenders fill crucial gaps when mainstream options won't work—time-critical settlements, credit-impaired borrowers, unusual properties, or complex situations that don't fit traditional lending boxes. Their premium rates (12-18%) reflect higher risk and faster service, but they enable transactions that couldn't otherwise proceed. Using private bridging strategically for 6-12 months before refinancing to conventional lending is common practice.

Working with experienced finance brokers who specialise in bridging loans helps you navigate this complex market efficiently. Discuss their fee structure upfront—brokers may receive commission from lenders, charge fees directly to clients, or use a combination of both models. Given bridging transactions are often time-sensitive, this expertise proves invaluable for avoiding wasted time on unsuitable lenders and ensuring your transaction settles successfully.

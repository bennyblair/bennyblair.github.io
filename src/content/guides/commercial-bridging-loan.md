<p><em>Speak with a broker about your options (no consumer credit).</em></p>
<h2>commercial bridging loan: quick overview</h2><p>If you’re weighing up commercial bridging loan for your business, this guide breaks down how it works in Australia, when it’s useful, what it costs, and how we structure it with lenders.</p><p><strong>What is commercial bridging loan?</strong> It’s a commercial finance solution used by Australian businesses. We arrange and negotiate terms with lenders, then coordinate credit and settlement.</p>
<h2>When to use it (Australian SMEs)</h2><ul><li>Time‑sensitive transactions (deadlines, settlements, supplier payments)</li><li>Funding tied to a clear exit (sale, refinance, receivables, progress claim)</li><li>Working capital gaps (seasonality, stock build, long debtor terms)</li><li>Where property, invoices, inventory or plant & equipment can support the facility</li></ul>
<h2>Rates, fees & typical terms</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Interest</th><td>0.8%–1.8% per month (interest-only)</td></tr><tr><th>Term</th><td>1–12 months (extensions possible)</td></tr><tr><th>LVR / Advance</th><td>Up to ~70% 1st mortgage; ~55–65% 2nd (asset/val dependent)</td></tr><tr><th>Security</th><td>1st/2nd mortgage over investment or commercial property; caveat</td></tr><tr><th>Typical fees</th><td>Establishment 1.5%–3.5% + legal/valuation</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These are indicative only and vary by lender, asset quality and exit.</p>
<h2>Eligibility & documents</h2><ul><li>ABN & photo ID</li><li>Rates notice & title search</li><li>Purpose & exit strategy</li><li>Assets & liabilities</li><li>Leases (if income-supporting)</li><li>Valuation (if required)</li></ul>

<h2>How we structure and negotiate with lenders</h2><ul><li>Map the lender landscape and shortlist realistic structures</li><li>Negotiate pricing and conditions with credit teams</li><li>Coordinate valuation, legals and settlement</li><li>Keep the facility strictly commercial (no consumer credit)</li></ul>
<h2>Deep dive: credit lens & negotiation levers</h2><ul><li>What credit teams weigh up (security quality, verifiable cash flows, exit credibility)</li><li>When second mortgages beat caveats (priority, consent, timing)</li><li>Leveraging valuations and rent rolls to improve pricing</li><li>Negotiation levers: LVR, term, interest prepayment, fees, covenants</li><li>Exit strategies that typically pass credit (sale, refinance, debtor collections)</li><li>Common pitfalls that slow deals (unclear purpose, missing docs, unrealistic exit)</li></ul>
<h2>FAQs</h2><dl><div><dt><strong>Is commercial bridging loan regulated under NCCP in Australia?</strong></dt><dd>For business‑purpose loans, NCCP consumer credit rules generally do not apply. We arrange commercial finance only.</dd></div><div><dt><strong>How fast can funding be arranged?</strong></dt><dd>Indicative terms are often achievable in 24–48 hours for straightforward scenarios. Settlement timing depends on security, docs and valuation.</dd></div><div><dt><strong>What security is usually required?</strong></dt><dd>Commonly 1st/2nd mortgage over investment or commercial property; caveat. The exact structure is lender‑ and asset‑dependent.</dd></div><div><dt><strong>What documents should I prepare up front?</strong></dt><dd>Photo ID, ABN, BAS/financials, bank statements, rates notice/title, plus asset/contract evidence.</dd></div><div><dt><strong>Can this help with ATO/tax or supplier arrears?</strong></dt><dd>Often yes, provided the exit is clear and security supports the risk.</dd></div></dl>

<h2>State‑by‑state nuances (high level)</h2>

<h2>Underwriting lens in practice</h2>
<ul><li>Security layers (1st vs 2nd mortgage, caveat, GSA) and priority/consents</li><li>LVR vs asset quality; lease WALE and income coverage where relevant</li><li>Serviceability vs asset‑based assessment; interest‑prepaid structures</li><li>Conditions precedent (valuations, QS, titles, insurances) and common waivers</li><li>Covenants and information undertakings that appear in term sheets</li></ul>
<h2>Illustrative cost breakdown (example only)</h2>
<table><tbody><tr><th>Facility size</th><td>$750,000</td></tr><tr><th>Term</th><td>6 months, interest‑only</td></tr><tr><th>Interest (illustrative)</th><td>1.4% per month, paid monthly or prepaid</td></tr><tr><th>Establishment</th><td>2.5% + legal/valuation at cost</td></tr><tr><th>Other</th><td>Disbursements, settlement agent, PPSR, title fees</td></tr><tr><th>Estimated total cost (ex‑GST)</th><td>Depends on days used; always scenario‑specific</td></tr></tbody></table>

<h2>Alternatives to consider</h2>
<ul><li>Invoice finance for debtor‑backed working capital</li><li>Trade finance for supplier deposits and shipping windows</li><li>Equipment finance where the asset holds value</li><li>Refinance of the primary facility (if bank appetite/stability allows)</li></ul>
<h2>Common mistakes that slow deals</h2>
<ul><li>Unclear exit or timeline</li><li>Missing title/rates docs or outdated valuations</li><li>Unverified arrears (ATO, suppliers) that emerge late</li><li>Over‑optimistic LVR expectations vs asset quality</li></ul>
<h2>Practical tips to improve pricing and speed</h2>
<ul><li>Start your data room early: photo ID, ABN, bank statements, BAS, rates notice, title search, lease docs and any valuations you have.</li><li>Be explicit on use‑of‑funds and exit steps with dates; this shortens credit cycles and reduces conditions.</li><li>Ask for two structures: lowest‑cost and fastest‑settling — you can decide based on deadlines and total cost of funds.</li><li>If there are arrears, provide statements upfront; surprises late in the process add risk margin.</li></ul>

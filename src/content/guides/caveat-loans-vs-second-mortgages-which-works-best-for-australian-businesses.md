For Australian businesses seeking fast access to capital, two common [private lending](/resources/guides/[second](/resources/guides/second-[mortgage](/resources/guides/second-mortgage-for-[business](/resources/guides/second-mortgage-for-business-in-australia-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it)-in-australia-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it)-for-business-in-australia-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it)-mortgage-for-business-in-australia-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it) tools are [caveat loans](/resources/guides/second-mortgage-for-business-in-australia-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it) and second mortgages. At first glance, they may look similar — both are secured against real property, both can settle quickly, and both are often used when traditional bank finance is too slow. But there are important differences in structure, risk, cost, and use cases.
This guide breaks down the key distinctions between caveat loans and second mortgages, when each might make sense, what lenders look for, and the risks to be aware of. It also includes a worked example to show how the numbers play out in practice. The goal is to help business owners and directors understand how these tools can solve immediate funding challenges — without mistaking them for permanent financing. Information is general only, not financial or credit advice.
What Is a Caveat Loan?
A caveat loan is a short-term facility secured by lodging a caveat on the title of a property. A caveat is a legal notice that prevents dealings with the property without the lender's consent.
Because a caveat does not give the lender the same rights as a registered mortgage, it is considered a lighter-touch security. This makes caveat loans faster to set up — often within 24 to 48 hours — but also means they are generally smaller, shorter-term, and riskier for lenders.
Businesses often use caveat loans to cover very short cashflow gaps, such as paying a tax bill due in days or bridging a receivable.
What Is a [second mortgage](/resources/guides/second-mortgage-for-business-in-australia-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it)?
A second mortgage is a fully registered security on the property, ranking behind the first mortgage. This means the second lender's interest is formally recorded, and if the property is sold, the first mortgagee gets paid out first.
Because the second lender has clearer rights than a caveat holder, second mortgages can support larger facilities and longer terms — typically from several months to a year. They require more documentation and sometimes intercreditor agreements, which adds time, but they also provide more certainty for both borrower and lender.
Key Differences Between Caveat Loans and Second Mortgages
The distinctions can be summarised across four dimensions:
•	Speed: Caveat loans often settle in 1–3 days. Second mortgages usually take longer — a week or more if deeds or consents are needed.
•	Size: Caveat loans are typically smaller, often up to a few hundred thousand dollars. Second mortgages can extend to millions, depending on equity and LVR.
•	Term: Caveat loans are very short — weeks to a few months. Second mortgages may stretch to 6–12 months or beyond.
•	Security: Caveat loans only block dealings; second mortgages provide registered rights, which gives lenders more comfort.
When to Use a Caveat Loan
A caveat loan is most appropriate when:
•	Funding is needed in days, not weeks.
•	The required amount is relatively small.
•	The purpose is short-lived, such as covering a tax bill or urgent supplier payment.
•	The borrower plans to repay from a near-term receivable.
Example: A wholesaler has $150,000 in ATO arrears due within five days. They expect a $250,000 receivable to land in three weeks. A caveat loan may cover the shortfall quickly and be repaid once the receivable clears.
When to Use a Second Mortgage
A second mortgage is more suitable when:
•	The business needs larger sums (hundreds of thousands to millions).
•	The purpose will take several months to resolve (e.g., completing a project or bridging to a dated settlement).
•	There is sufficient equity and a credible exit such as a sale or refinance.
•	The business wants capitalised interest to avoid monthly repayments.
Example: A property developer requires $500,000 to finish works on an apartment project. With $2m of equity in another property and a dated sales contract in six months, a second mortgage is more appropriate than a caveat loan.
Costs and Risks Compared
Both caveat loans and second mortgages are more expensive than senior bank debt. Key points:
•	Interest rates: Caveat loans often carry higher monthly rates (2–4%) due to speed and risk. Second mortgages are lower (1–2% monthly) but run longer.
•	Fees: Establishment and legal fees apply to both, with caveat loans often having fewer upfront legal costs.
•	Risks: Caveat loans risk default if receivables don't arrive as expected. Second mortgages risk over-gearing if property values fall or exits slip.
Conclusion
Both caveat loans and second mortgages have a place in the Australian private lending market. Caveat loans are the sprint — fast, small, and short. Second mortgages are the middle-distance runner — slower to arrange, larger, and designed for multi-month timelines. Choosing the right tool depends on urgency, funding size, equity available, and the reliability of the exit. Businesses should use each carefully and only as part of a clear, short-term strategy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the main difference between a caveat loan and a second mortgage?

A caveat loan is secured by lodging a caveat, while a second mortgage is a registered mortgage that ranks behind the first. The latter gives stronger legal rights.

### Which one is faster to arrange?

Caveat loans are usually faster — they can settle in as little as 24–48 hours. Second mortgages take longer due to legal and intercreditor steps.

### Which one can fund larger amounts?

Second mortgages typically allow larger loan sizes because the lender's position on title is stronger.

### Can interest be capitalised on both?

Often yes, but more common with second mortgages. Caveat loans may require short-term interest servicing depending on lender policy.

### Which carries more risk for the borrower?

Both carry risks, but caveat loans can be especially risky if the planned exit (like a receivable) does not land on time, leading to rapid default.

### Are they consumer loans?

No. Both are for business purposes only.

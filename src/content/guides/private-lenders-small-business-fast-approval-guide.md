# Private Lenders for Small Business: Fast Approval Guide

Private lenders for small business fill a critical gap in Australia's commercial finance landscape, providing funding to enterprises that banks systematically decline or can't accommodate within practical timeframes. Small businesses—typically those with revenue under $5 million—face unique challenges accessing traditional bank finance: limited trading history, seasonal cash flows, owner-operator structures, or unconventional business models that don't fit bank lending templates. When banks say no, private lenders often say yes, though at premium pricing reflecting the higher risk profiles and faster approval processes they accommodate.

The private lending market for small business has expanded substantially over the past decade as non-bank lenders, private investment funds, and high-net-worth individuals recognise profitable opportunities in this underserved segment. A Melbourne café owner needing $150,000 for fit-out expansion might face bank decline due to insufficient trading history despite strong revenue growth, yet secure approval from private lenders within days based on equipment security and demonstrated customer demand. Private lenders assess deals differently than banks—focusing on asset security, business fundamentals, and owner commitment rather than complex credit scoring and serviceability calculations.

Understanding how private lenders for small business operate—their assessment criteria, typical terms, costs, and expectations—helps you access this alternative funding source effectively whilst managing the premium pricing inherent in private finance. Interest rates typically range from 12% to 30% annually depending on security, business strength, and loan structure, with terms spanning 6 to 36 months. This guide explores when private lending suits small businesses, how to find appropriate lenders, what they examine during assessment, and strategies to structure applications maximising approval likelihood whilst minimising costs.

## Understanding Private Lending for Small Business

Private lenders for small business operate fundamentally differently from banks, using alternative assessment frameworks that enable them to approve deals banks systematically decline. Recognising these differences helps you approach private lenders appropriately and set realistic expectations.

### Why Banks Decline Small Business Lending

Traditional banks apply standardised lending criteria that systematically disadvantage many small businesses. Minimum trading history requirements—typically 2 to 3 years—exclude newer enterprises regardless of growth trajectories or market demand. A Sydney tech startup generating $400,000 revenue in year one but only trading 18 months faces automatic bank decline despite strong fundamentals and growth projections showing clear viability.

Serviceability calculations based on historical financials penalise seasonal businesses or those experiencing rapid growth. Banks use trailing 12-month figures that don't reflect current performance, meaning a Brisbane hospitality business that doubled revenue over the past six months still gets assessed on weaker historical numbers. This backward-looking approach creates funding gaps for businesses at inflection points requiring capital to capture growth opportunities.

### How Private Lenders Assess Small Businesses

Private lenders for small business focus on fundamentals banks overlook: current revenue trends, asset security available, management capability, and market opportunity rather than rigid credit scoring. They'll examine your last 3 to 6 months of business banking transactions to understand real-time cash flows instead of relying solely on annual financial statements potentially 6 to 12 months out of date.

Asset-based assessment dominates private lending decisions. Do you have equipment, inventory, vehicles, or property providing tangible security? A Perth trades business with $200,000 in vehicles and equipment can likely secure $100,000 to $140,000 funding based substantially on that security, even with credit impairments that would cause bank decline. Private lenders understand forced sale values and discount accordingly, but physical assets provide downside protection enabling approval despite business risks.

### Types of Private Business Lenders

Private lenders for small business comprise several categories. Non-bank lenders—finance companies operating without banking licences—represent the most institutionalised option, offering standardised products, established application processes, and regulatory oversight through ASIC. These lenders typically provide $50,000 to $2 million for small businesses, with interest rates from 12% to 24% annually depending on security and risk profile.

Private investment funds pool capital from multiple investors, deploying it across small business lending to diversify risk whilst targeting returns of 15% to 25% annually. Individual high-net-worth lenders represent the most flexible option—successful business people, retired executives, or property investors lending from personal capital. These individuals might lend $50,000 to $1 million, charging 15% to 30% annually depending on their risk perception and return requirements.

## Common Small Business Funding Scenarios

Private lenders for small business excel in specific scenarios where their flexibility, speed, and alternative assessment approaches solve problems traditional lenders can't accommodate effectively.

### Working Capital and Cash Flow Gaps

Seasonal businesses often require [working capital loans for Australian SMEs](/resources/guides/working-capital-loans-for-smes) during low-revenue periods to maintain operations until peak seasons arrive. A Gold Coast tourism operator might need $80,000 in April to cover May-July operating expenses before summer tourism generates strong cash flows. Banks struggle with these patterns, whilst private lenders can structure 6 to 9-month facilities bridging the gap with repayment when revenue returns.

Rapid growth creates counterintuitive cash flow challenges—increasing sales require more inventory, larger premises, or additional staff before revenue from those sales materialises. A Melbourne e-commerce business growing 30% monthly might need $150,000 working capital funding larger inventory purchases, despite strong revenue growth suggesting viability.

### Equipment and Asset Purchases

[Equipment finance and leasing for Australian businesses](/resources/guides/equipment-finance-and-leasing-australia) through private lenders enables asset acquisition when banks decline. A Brisbane construction business needing a $180,000 excavator but lacking sufficient trading history for bank approval might secure private equipment finance using the excavator itself as security. Private lenders advance 60% to 80% of equipment value, knowing they can repossess and sell the asset if repayments fail.

Urgent equipment replacement can't wait for 6 to 8-week bank approval processes. When critical equipment fails—a commercial kitchen's refrigeration system, a manufacturer's CNC machine, or a transport company's primary vehicle—businesses need immediate replacement to avoid revenue loss exceeding financing costs.

### Business Acquisition Opportunities

Time-sensitive acquisition opportunities require funding speed banks can't deliver. When competitors liquidate, retiring owners sell established operations, or distressed businesses become available at significant discounts, buyers need capital within weeks not months. A Perth hospitality group might identify a competitor's café available for $350,000—representing substantial discount from $500,000 market value—but requiring settlement within 30 days. Private lenders providing $250,000 acquisition funding within 2 weeks enable capturing this opportunity.

Vendor finance gaps also require private lending. Vendors might provide partial funding—perhaps 50% to 60% of purchase price—but buyers need additional capital closing the gap between vendor finance and their available deposit.

## Interest Rates and Loan Terms

Private lenders for small business charge premium rates reflecting higher risk profiles, faster approvals, and flexible structures unavailable through traditional channels. Understanding typical pricing helps you assess whether quotes represent fair market rates or excessive charges suggesting you continue shopping.

### Rate Structures and Pricing Factors

Private small business lending rates currently range from 12% to 30% annually, with most transactions falling between 15% and 22%. Secured lending—backed by equipment, inventory, vehicles, or property—attracts the lower end of this range (12% to 18%), whilst unsecured facilities or those with significant risk factors reach 20% to 30%. An Adelaide manufacturing business borrowing $200,000 secured by $350,000 in machinery might receive 14% to 16% rates, whilst an unsecured $80,000 working capital facility for a startup faces 22% to 26%.

Several factors drive rate variations. Trading history significantly impacts pricing—businesses trading profitably for 2-plus years receive better rates (saving 3% to 5% annually) than startups under 12 months. Asset security quality matters enormously—lending against readily marketable equipment or vehicles costs 5% to 8% less than lending against specialised equipment with limited resale markets.

### Loan Terms and Repayment Options

Private small business loans typically span 6 to 36 months, with 12 to 24 months most common. These short terms reflect private lending's role as transitional finance—bridging to bank refinancing once businesses establish sufficient track record, funding specific growth initiatives before internally generated cash flows sustain operations, or providing working capital during defined seasonal or project cycles.

Repayment structures vary substantially by loan purpose and cash flow patterns. Working capital loans often structure as interest-only with principal due at maturity, preserving operating cash whilst relying on business growth or asset sales generating repayment capacity. Equipment finance typically uses monthly principal-and-interest payments matching equipment's productive life.

### Fees and Additional Costs

Establishment fees typically range from 2% to 5% of loan amount. A $150,000 private business loan with 3% establishment fee costs $4,500 upfront—money you must either pay from existing funds or capitalise into the loan amount. Application or assessment fees might add $1,000 to $3,000, covering lender's initial evaluation work.

Monthly account-keeping or administration fees of $50 to $300 add to total costs. These seem small individually but accumulate to $600 to $3,600 annually—meaningful amounts for small businesses operating on tight margins. Calculate total cost of borrowing including all fees, interest, and charges over your expected loan duration before committing.

## Preparing Your Private Lending Application

Successfully accessing private lenders for small business requires strategic preparation that addresses their specific assessment priorities and demonstrates your creditworthiness through their evaluation framework rather than bank criteria.

### Essential Documentation Requirements

Private lenders require less documentation than banks but still need core information demonstrating business viability and repayment capacity. Three to six months of business bank statements provide real-time cash flow visibility private lenders prioritise over historical financial statements. They'll examine transaction patterns, revenue trends, expense management, and cash flow consistency to assess ongoing business health.

Recent BAS statements or activity statements show tax compliance and revenue trajectories. Two to four quarters of BAS demonstrate business scale and growth patterns whilst confirming you're meeting tax obligations—private lenders won't fund businesses falling behind on ATO commitments. Financial statements for the past 1 to 2 years provide historical context, though private lenders weight these less heavily than banks.

### Demonstrating Business Viability

Beyond documentation, private lenders want to understand your business story: how it operates, generates revenue, manages competition, and will repay the loan. Prepare a concise business summary (2 to 3 pages) explaining your business model, target customers, competitive advantages, and growth plans. This narrative helps lenders understand context that numbers alone don't convey.

Clear repayment strategies matter enormously. Explain specifically how you'll repay: increased sales from expansion, cost savings from new equipment, contract revenues, or asset sales. Vague statements like "business profits" prove insufficient—private lenders want detailed cash flow projections showing exactly when and how repayment capacity materialises.

### Offering Appropriate Security

Asset security dramatically improves approval likelihood and reduces rates by 5% to 10% annually. Inventory the assets you can offer: equipment, vehicles, inventory, accounts receivable, intellectual property, or property. Each asset type requires different documentation—equipment appraisals, vehicle valuations, inventory aging reports, or property valuations.

Personal guarantees and assets strengthen applications when business assets alone prove insufficient. Directors' guarantees make business owners personally liable for repayment, significantly increasing lender comfort. However, understand the risks: defaulting on business debt secured by personal assets puts your family home at risk.

## Finding and Selecting Private Lenders

Identifying appropriate private lenders for small business and selecting among options requires understanding various discovery channels and evaluation criteria distinguishing quality lenders from problematic operators.

### Discovery Channels and Networking

Online research identifies some private lenders—searches for "private business lenders Australia" or "alternative small business finance" reveal non-bank lenders and some private funds maintaining web presence. However, many private lenders, particularly individual high-net-worth sources, don't advertise publicly, preferring pre-qualified opportunities through trusted intermediaries.

Mortgage and finance brokers specialising in [what is private lending](/resources/guides/what-is-private-lending-australia) provide the most efficient discovery channel for most small businesses. These intermediaries maintain relationships with multiple private lenders, understanding each's current appetite, pricing, and approval criteria. Brokers pre-qualify your scenario, target appropriate lenders, and manage application presentation—services often meaning the difference between approval and decline for borderline situations.

Discuss their fee structure upfront—brokers may receive commission from lenders, charge fees directly to clients, or use a combination of both models. Commission-based brokers receive 2% to 5% of loan amount from lenders upon settlement, whilst fee-based brokers might charge $2,000 to $8,000 flat fees or 1% to 2% of loan amount.

### Evaluating Lender Credibility

Research potential lenders thoroughly before proceeding. Check ASIC registers confirming proper licensing for non-bank lenders providing credit. Search online reviews and testimonials, though interpret cautiously—occasional negative reviews occur even for reputable lenders, whilst complete absence of any online presence might signal legitimate privacy preference or concerning lack of track record.

Request references from lenders—previous clients they've funded in similar situations. Reputable lenders readily provide references, though recognise these represent their best outcomes rather than typical experiences. Ask references about approval process smoothness, transparency around fees and terms, and responsiveness to queries.

### Red Flags to Avoid

Upfront fee requests before loan approval signal potential problems. Reasonable application fees ($500 to $1,500) for assessment work are acceptable, but demands for large upfront payments ($5,000-plus) before any approval suggest possible fraud. Legitimate lenders work predominantly on success fees—paid only when loans settle—aligning their interests with achieving positive outcomes for borrowers.

Guaranteed approval promises regardless of circumstances prove unrealistic. Every lender conducts legitimate risk assessment. Claims of "guaranteed approval" suggest either fraud or unconscionable lending. Pressure tactics rushing decisions without adequate time for review raise concerns.

## Managing Private Lending Relationships

Successfully working with private lenders for small business extends beyond initial approval to ongoing relationship management throughout your loan term, impacting both current arrangement success and future borrowing opportunities.

### Communication and Reporting

Proactive communication with private lenders throughout your loan term builds confidence and goodwill valuable if challenges arise. Provide quarterly updates even when everything proceeds smoothly—brief emails outlining revenue performance, any significant business developments, and confirmation that repayments remain comfortable.

Communicate problems early rather than missing payments without explanation. If unexpected challenges emerge threatening your ability to meet scheduled payments, contact your lender immediately explaining circumstances and proposing solutions. Most private lenders prefer working with transparent borrowers facing temporary difficulties over those who go silent.

### Refinancing and Exit Strategies

Plan refinancing to traditional lenders before private loan maturity. Private lending works best as transitional finance whilst you build track record enabling cheaper bank funding. Start exploring bank refinancing 6 to 9 months before private loan maturity—bank approval processes take 6 to 12 weeks even for established businesses, so early engagement prevents forced extensions or expensive renewals.

Document improvements strengthening your refinancing position. If you used private finance because of limited trading history, your business now has additional trading quarters demonstrating stability. Present these improvements clearly to bank lenders, positioning private lending as intentional bridge to traditional funding.

### Building Long-Term Lender Relationships

Private lenders who profit from your first loan often provide improved terms on subsequent borrowing. Demonstrate yourself as reliable by meeting all obligations on your initial loan—timely payments, transparent communication, proper security maintenance, and successful repayment or refinancing. Established relationships typically deliver 1% to 3% better rates, reduced establishment fees, and faster approval than new lender applications.

## FAQ Section

**What interest rates do private lenders charge small businesses?**
Private lenders for small business typically charge 12% to 30% annually, with most transactions falling between 15% and 22%. Secured lending backed by equipment or vehicles attracts lower rates (12% to 18%), whilst unsecured facilities face 20% to 30%. Trading history impacts pricing—established businesses receive 3% to 5% better rates than startups. Security quality matters enormously—readily marketable assets save 5% to 8% versus specialised equipment. Total borrowing costs include establishment fees (2% to 5%), monthly account fees ($50 to $300), and potential early repayment charges, adding 10% to 25% to base interest over typical 12 to 24-month terms.

**How quickly can private lenders approve small business loans?**
Private lenders typically approve applications within 2 to 7 business days, with simple scenarios receiving approval within 48 to 72 hours. Non-bank lenders generally take 3 to 5 days, whilst individual private lenders sometimes approve within 24 to 48 hours. Funding settlement occurs 3 to 10 days after approval. Total timeframe from enquiry to funds receipt typically spans 1 to 2 weeks for standard scenarios. This remains dramatically faster than bank commercial lending requiring 6 to 12 weeks.

**Do I need perfect credit to access private small business lenders?**
No, private lenders commonly approve borrowers with credit impairments that would cause automatic bank decline. They focus on current business performance, asset security, and repayment capacity rather than historical credit scores. Many accept satisfied defaults from 1 to 3 years prior or past bankruptcies discharged 2-plus years ago. However, credit impairments typically result in higher interest rates (adding 3% to 8% annually) and lower maximum loan amounts. The key distinction: private lenders accept credit challenges at appropriate pricing rather than declining automatically.

**What security do private lenders accept from small businesses?**
Private lenders accept equipment (machinery, tools, computers), vehicles (trucks, vans), inventory, accounts receivable, commercial property, and personal assets (family homes, investment properties). Security values typically support 60% to 80% lending ratios—$100,000 equipment might secure $60,000 to $80,000 loans. Readily marketable assets command higher lending ratios than specialised equipment. Personal guarantees strengthen applications when business security alone proves insufficient, though this creates personal liability if repayment fails.

**Should I use a broker to find private small business lenders?**
Using experienced finance brokers specialising in private lending typically delivers better outcomes than direct approaches. Brokers maintain relationships with multiple private lenders, pre-qualify scenarios, and position applications strategically. This expertise often means approval versus decline for borderline applications. However, broker services cost 2% to 5% of loan amount through commissions or $2,000 to $8,000 in direct fees. For straightforward applications with strong security, direct approaches might save costs. For complex situations or credit impairments, broker expertise typically justifies the expense.

**How do private business loans differ from bank loans?**
Private loans differ fundamentally: approval speed of 2 to 7 days versus 6 to 12 weeks for banks; assessment emphasising current cash flows and asset security versus banks prioritising historical financials; eligibility accepting newer businesses (6 to 12 months trading) and credit impairments versus banks requiring 2-plus years and clean credit. However, private rates of 12% to 30% exceed bank rates of 7% to 12%, with shorter 6 to 36-month terms versus 3 to 7 years, and higher establishment fees of 2% to 5% versus under 1%.

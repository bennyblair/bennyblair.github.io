# Private Lending vs Bank Loans: What Australian Businesses Need to Know

For many Australian businesses, the default path to funding is a bank loan. Banks offer lower interest rates and longer terms, but they also require exhaustive documentation and time. For businesses that need funds quickly, or those with imperfect financials, private lending can be a practical alternative.

This article compares private lending with traditional bank finance, outlining the differences in speed, eligibility, pricing, and risks. The goal is to help directors and business owners understand when each option makes sense, and why private lending is not a replacement for banks but a complement.

## What Is Private Lending?

Private lending refers to finance provided by non-bank institutions or individuals. Facilities are typically secured against property and structured for short-term, business-purpose funding. Common products include:

- **Caveat loans** — fast, short-term facilities
- **Second mortgages** — larger, medium-term facilities
- **Bridging loans** — tied to specific, dated cash inflows

Private lenders focus less on historic financials and more on the strength of the security property and the clarity of the exit.

## What Are Bank Loans?

Bank loans are provided by major banks and lenders regulated under the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). They include overdrafts, term loans, and property-secured facilities.

Banks offer:

- Lower interest rates
- Longer terms (years, not months)
- Larger maximum loan sizes

However, they require extensive documentation and longer approval processes.

## Key Differences Between Private and Bank Lending

| **Criteria** | **Private Lending** | **Bank Lending** |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Speed** | Settle in days or weeks | Can take months |
| **Eligibility** | Focus on property equity and exits | Require financial statements, tax returns, and serviceability tests |
| **Cost** | More expensive (1–2% monthly) | Lower rates (<10% annually) |
| **Purpose** | Temporary bridges | Long-term facilities |
| **Risk** | Higher costs and shorter timelines | More sustainable if you qualify |

## When Businesses Choose Private Lending

Private lending makes sense when:

- Funding is needed urgently (settlement deadlines, ATO arrears, supplier payments)
- A business has equity in property but lacks bank-ready financials
- A dated exit (sale, receivable, refinance) is already locked in

**Example**: A construction company facing a $400k tax bill with a property settlement due in six weeks may use a caveat loan to bridge the gap.

## When Banks Are Better

Banks remain the best option when:

- The business has strong financials and can pass serviceability tests
- Funding needs are long-term (years, not months)
- Interest cost is critical
- There is no clear short-term exit to repay a private facility

## Risks of Private Lending vs Banks

### Private Lending Risks
- Higher costs, shorter terms, reliance on exits
- Over-gearing is a risk if values fall

### Bank Loan Risks
- Longer timelines may cause businesses to miss opportunities
- Defaults can damage credit history

## Conclusion

Private lending and bank finance serve different purposes. Private lending provides speed and flexibility when timing is critical, while bank loans provide sustainable, low-cost funding for the long term. Smart businesses often use both — private lending as a bridge, and bank loans as the destination.

## FAQs

**How fast can private loans settle compared to banks?**
Private loans can settle in days, while banks may take weeks or months.

**Why are private loans more expensive?**
They involve higher risk to the lender and shorter timelines, so pricing reflects this.

**Can I refinance a private loan into a bank loan?**
Yes, many businesses do exactly this once financials are in order.

**Is private lending regulated the same as banks?**
No. Private lenders are not APRA-regulated banks, though they must comply with corporate and consumer credit laws (if applicable).

**Should I always prefer banks?**
If you qualify and can wait, yes. But private lending fills the gap when banks can't deliver in time.

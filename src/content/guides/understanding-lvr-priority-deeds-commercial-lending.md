# Understanding Loan-to-Value Ratios (LVRs) and Priority Deeds in Commercial Lending

## Introduction

When businesses borrow against property, two concepts often determine whether a deal proceeds smoothly or stalls: the Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR) and the priority deed (sometimes called an intercreditor deed). Both are central to private lending in Australia, especially when multiple facilities such as first mortgages, second mortgages, or bridging loans are stacked against the same property.

This guide explains what LVRs are, why lenders are so focused on them, and how priority deeds function when more than one lender has security over a property. Understanding these terms helps directors prepare better funding applications and avoid delays that can derail time-sensitive deals. Information here is general only and not financial or credit advice.

## What Is a Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR)?

The LVR is the ratio of total loans secured by a property to its assessed value. It tells lenders how much "buffer" exists between the debt and the property's market value.

For example, if a property is valued at $2 million and total secured debt is $1.2 million, the LVR is 60%. If a new loan of $400,000 is added, the combined LVR rises to 80%.

Private lenders are conservative with LVRs because their recovery depends on property values. Typical combined LVR caps range from 65–75% for second mortgages and bridging loans.

## Why LVR Matters for Businesses

LVR directly affects:

- **Borrowing capacity**: Higher property values or lower existing debt allow larger facilities
- **Pricing**: Lower LVRs mean less risk for lenders and therefore sharper pricing
- **Exit feasibility**: A sale or refinance must comfortably cover the loan balance and costs

Directors who miscalculate LVR often find that their requested loan size is cut back by the lender. Preparing realistic numbers up front saves time and improves credibility.

## What Is a Priority Deed?

When more than one lender has security over a property, a priority deed (or intercreditor deed) is often required. This is a legal agreement between the first mortgagee and the subsequent lender, setting out:

- Which lender gets paid first in enforcement
- Whether the junior lender can capitalise interest
- The maximum debt allowed under each facility
- How sale proceeds are divided

Without this agreement, a second mortgage lender may refuse to advance funds, as they lack certainty on their rights.

## Why Priority Deeds Can Delay Settlement

Priority deeds involve multiple parties — the first mortgagee, the second lender, and their respective lawyers. This process can create delays, especially if the first lender is a major bank with standard but slow processes.

Businesses should anticipate this and factor time into their funding plans. Some lenders avoid intercreditor arrangements altogether by offering caveat loans, which can settle faster but with smaller amounts and higher risk.

## Worked Example

A logistics company owns a depot valued at $3m with a $1.5m bank mortgage. It seeks a $600k second mortgage.

- Combined LVR = ($1.5m + $0.6m) ÷ $3m = 70%
- The private lender requires a priority deed from the bank
- The bank takes 4 weeks to issue consent

**Result**: although the second mortgage is approved, delays in the deed process nearly cause the company to miss a supplier payment deadline. Planning ahead could have avoided the stress.

## Risks and Considerations

**Over-gearing**: Borrowing close to the maximum LVR leaves little buffer for market changes.

**Timing**: Priority deeds can take weeks; urgent deals may require alternatives.

**Costs**: Lawyers' fees for deeds can run into thousands.

**Exit mismatch**: Even if LVR is acceptable, an unrealistic exit plan can still derail approval.

## Conclusion

LVRs and priority deeds may sound technical, but they shape the reality of commercial lending. Understanding them helps businesses plan more effectively, avoid last-minute surprises, and choose the right funding structure. For directors, the lesson is clear: know your LVR and anticipate intercreditor requirements early in the process.

## FAQs

**What is LVR in lending?**  
It is the ratio of total debt secured by a property to its value, expressed as a percentage.

**What is a safe LVR for second mortgages?**  
Most private lenders prefer combined LVRs below 70%, though exact limits vary.

**What is a priority deed?**  
A legal agreement between lenders outlining rights, ranking, and repayment order when multiple facilities exist.

**Why do priority deeds cause delays?**  
They require legal input from multiple parties, and banks can be slow to consent.

**Can a deal proceed without a priority deed?**  
Sometimes, if structured as a caveat loan. However, this usually means smaller facilities and higher costs.

**Are these tools relevant to consumer lending?**  
No. They apply to business-purpose, property-secured loans only.

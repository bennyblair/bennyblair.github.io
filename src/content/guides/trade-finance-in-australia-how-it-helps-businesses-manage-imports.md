# Trade Finance in Australia — How It Helps Businesses Manage Imports and Supplier Payments

International trade is vital for Australian businesses, but it comes with one major challenge: suppliers often demand upfront payment, while customers may not pay until weeks or months later. This gap can strain working capital and restrict growth opportunities.

Trade finance provides a structured solution, allowing businesses to pay overseas or local suppliers while giving them time to collect from customers. From small importers to established wholesalers, trade finance helps smooth cashflow and reduce reliance on equity injections or expensive short-term debt.

This guide explains what trade finance is, how it works in Australia, typical eligibility and costs, common risks, and practical alternatives. It also includes examples and FAQs. All information is general only and not financial or credit advice.

## What is Trade Finance?

Trade finance is a facility that enables businesses to pay suppliers upfront while deferring repayment until after goods are sold or customers have paid.

Common forms include:

- **Import finance**: Pays overseas suppliers, often in foreign currency.
- **Export finance**: Provides funding until export receivables are paid.
- **Letters of credit**: A bank guarantee of payment to a supplier, reducing risk for both sides.
- **Documentary collections**: Payment triggered when shipping documents are received.

## When Trade Finance Makes Sense

Trade finance is useful when:

- Suppliers require deposits or full payment before shipping goods.
- Businesses need to match cash inflows with outflows (customer payments vs supplier terms).
- Large orders would otherwise lock up too much capital.
- Importers want to hedge foreign currency risk while managing working capital.
- Seasonal businesses need to secure stock ahead of demand.

## Eligibility and Requirements

Eligibility depends on the business's trading record and the reliability of counterparties.

Typical requirements include:

- ABN and active trading history (usually 12+ months).
- Established supplier contracts and purchase orders.
- Evidence of customer demand (e.g., sales history or contracts).
- Credit checks on both the business and key customers.

Documents required:

- Supplier invoices and contracts.
- Purchase orders or shipping documentation.
- Financial statements and BAS returns.

## Costs and Terms

Trade finance is short-term in nature, with terms usually between 30 and 180 days.

Typical features:

- **Advance rate**: Often up to 100% of supplier invoice value.
- **Interest rates**: Higher than bank overdrafts but cheaper than unsecured short-term loans.
- **Fees**: Establishment fee, currency exchange costs (if relevant).

### Example:

- A business imports $300,000 of stock.
- Trade financier pays supplier upfront.
- Repayment required in 120 days.
- Cost: 1.5% per 30 days = $18,000 in finance charges.

## Risks and Red Flags

While trade finance can unlock growth, risks include:

- **Currency risk**: If not hedged, exchange rates can increase costs.
- **Supplier risk**: If goods arrive late or faulty, repayment is still required.
- **Over-reliance**: Businesses may overstretch by financing too many orders.
- **Higher cost vs secured bank debt**: Especially for SMEs without long trading histories.

## Case Example: Sydney Importer

A Sydney-based furniture importer needed $400,000 to pay Chinese suppliers for a container shipment. Customers in Australia were on 60-day payment terms. The trade finance facility covered 100% of supplier costs, repaid once customers paid. This allowed the importer to secure the stock, meet retail demand, and avoid equity dilution.

## Alternatives to Trade Finance

Other solutions may work depending on circumstances:

- **Invoice finance**: Unlocks cash once goods are sold and invoices are issued.
- **Caveat loans or second mortgages**: Property-secured options for larger working capital injections.
- **Overdrafts**: Bank facilities for businesses with strong financials.
- **Supplier credit terms**: Negotiating extended terms directly with suppliers.

## FAQs

**What is the difference between trade finance and invoice finance?**
Trade finance pays suppliers upfront; invoice finance unlocks cash once goods are sold and invoiced.

**Can startups use trade finance?**
Usually difficult without trading history, but possible if backed by strong contracts.

**How long are trade finance terms?**
Typically 30–180 days, aligned with sales cycles.

**Is foreign exchange included?**
Some providers integrate FX solutions into facilities; others require separate hedging.

**Is trade finance secured?**
It can be unsecured or backed by receivables, stock, or property depending on provider.

**Is this advice?**
No. This is general information only, not financial or credit advice.

## Glossary

**Letter of Credit (LC)**: Bank guarantee of supplier payment.

**Documentary Collection**: Payment triggered by shipping documents.

**Advance Rate**: Percentage of supplier invoice funded.

**FX Hedging**: Protecting against foreign exchange movements.

**Working Capital Cycle**: Time between paying suppliers and receiving customer payments.

## Conclusion

Trade finance is a flexible tool that helps Australian businesses bridge the gap between supplier payments and customer receipts. It supports growth, reduces cashflow stress, and enables businesses to take on larger opportunities. However, it carries costs and risks that should be carefully weighed against alternatives.

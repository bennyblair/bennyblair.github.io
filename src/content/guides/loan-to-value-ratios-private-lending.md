# Loan-to-Value Ratios (LVR) in Private Lending: Why They Matter for Australian Businesses

## Introduction

When Australian businesses explore private lending, one term comes up again and again: Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR). While banks obsess over serviceability, credit history, and compliance with APRA lending standards, private lenders focus squarely on the quality of the property security and the LVR.

For directors unfamiliar with commercial finance, understanding LVR can feel like jargon. Yet it's the linchpin of private funding approvals — influencing how much you can borrow, the interest rate you'll pay, and whether your loan is approved at all.

This guide breaks down LVR in plain English: what it is, how it's calculated, why it matters to private lenders, common pitfalls, and practical tips for businesses seeking short-term or bridging finance. It also covers risks, examples, and FAQs so directors can approach funding conversations prepared. Information here is general only and not financial or credit advice.

## What Is Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR)?

LVR expresses the loan amount as a percentage of the property value used as security.

**Formula:**
```
LVR = (Total Loan Amount / Assessed Property Value) × 100
```

**Example:**
- Property value: $1,000,000
- Loan amount: $650,000
- LVR = 65%

This simple ratio is the benchmark test for private lenders.

## How Lenders Assess Property Value

One source of confusion is how property value is determined:

- **Bank valuations**: Independent reports, often conservative
- **Private lender valuations**: May use desktop or kerbside assessments
- **Borrower expectations**: Often higher than lender valuations

Private lenders typically err on the conservative side. A property the borrower thinks is worth $1.2m might be assessed at $1m, instantly shifting the LVR.

## Typical LVR Caps in Private Lending

- **First mortgages**: Usually capped at 65–70%
- **Second mortgages**: Combined LVR (first + second) rarely above 75–80%
- **Caveat loans**: Often 50–65% due to weaker legal position
- **Special assets**: Commercial, rural, or specialised properties may attract lower caps

These caps exist to provide a buffer against market changes and ensure the lender can recover funds in a worst-case scenario.

## Why LVR Matters to Borrowers

Understanding your LVR helps you:

- **Estimate borrowing capacity**: Higher property equity = larger loan potential
- **Gauge pricing**: Lower LVRs usually mean sharper interest rates
- **Speed up approvals**: If your deal is well below cap, settlement can be lightning fast
- **Avoid wasted applications**: If your deal is over cap, no amount of negotiation will push it through

For directors, knowing the numbers upfront saves time and avoids surprises.

## Worked Example 1: Second Mortgage

- Property value: $2m
- Existing first mortgage: $1.2m
- Desired second mortgage: $400k
- Combined total: $1.6m
- **Combined LVR**: $1.6m ÷ $2m = 80%

At 80%, many private lenders will hesitate or reduce the loan size. If the property were valued at $1.9m instead, LVR rises to 84%, making approval highly unlikely.

## Worked Example 2: Bridging Loan

- Property value: $3m
- First mortgage: $1.5m
- Bridging loan: $750k
- **Combined LVR**: ($1.5m + $750k) ÷ $3m = 75%

This fits within common private lender caps, especially with a contracted sale as exit.

## Common Mistakes Businesses Make With LVR

- **Overestimating property values**: Borrowers assume higher valuations than lenders
- **Ignoring combined LVR**: Both first and second mortgages must be counted
- **Not factoring capitalised interest**: Loan balances grow over time, raising LVR
- **Assuming bank-style leverage applies**: Banks sometimes lend at 80–90% for residential — private lenders rarely do

## Risks of High LVRs

- **Reduced buffer**: If property prices fall, recovery may fall short
- **Exit stress**: Higher LVRs leave little margin for costs, fees, or delays
- **Extension challenges**: Lenders may refuse extensions if LVR breaches thresholds

High LVRs increase risk for both lenders and borrowers, making deals harder to approve and more expensive.

## How to Strengthen Your LVR Position

- **Keep leverage conservative**: Aim for <70% combined
- **Provide recent valuations**: Independent reports can reduce uncertainty
- **Show a strong exit**: A dated sale or refinance reassures lenders
- **Use multiple properties**: Spreading loans across assets reduces LVR pressure

## Checklist: Preparing for LVR Conversations

- Gather first mortgage statements
- Obtain a realistic property valuation
- Calculate combined LVR (first + proposed second)
- Factor in capitalised interest and fees
- Prepare an exit strategy that works within caps

## FAQs

### What is LVR in private lending?
It's the ratio of total debt secured against a property to its assessed value.

### What LVRs do private lenders accept?
65–70% for first mortgages, 75–80% combined for seconds.

### How is property value determined?
Through valuations or conservative desktop estimates.

### What happens if my LVR is too high?
The loan may be reduced or declined.

### Does LVR include capitalised interest?
Yes. Future interest is factored into maximum balances.

### Are private lender LVRs higher or lower than banks?
Lower. Private lenders stay conservative due to higher risks.

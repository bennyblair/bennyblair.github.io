# Private Lending in Sydney: A Guide for Businesses

## Introduction

Sydney is the beating heart of Australia's economy. From construction and property development to logistics and professional services, businesses across the city often face short-term funding gaps that banks cannot fill quickly.

When deadlines are measured in days — not months — many directors turn to private lending. In Sydney, private lenders play a crucial role in bridging timing mismatches, funding urgent obligations, and unlocking opportunities that would otherwise slip away.

This guide explains how private lending works specifically in the Sydney market. We cover common loan types, typical borrower scenarios, location-based case studies, and practical tips for businesses considering private funding. Information here is general only and not financial or credit advice.

## Why Private Lending Is Popular in Sydney

**High property values**: Sydney's property market provides strong security for private loans.

**Fast-moving deals**: Developers and investors face tight deadlines.

**Diverse industries**: From tech start-ups to logistics firms, many sectors require quick capital injections.

**Bank constraints**: Traditional lenders often take weeks to approve loans, making them unsuitable for urgent deals.

## Types of Private Lending in Sydney

**Caveat loans**: Ultra-fast, short-term loans (days).

**Second mortgages**: Larger amounts, months to years.

**Bridging loans**: Cover gaps between purchase and sale.

**ATO tax debt funding**: Keeps businesses compliant while refinancing.

**Development finance**: Unlocks equity for construction or project completion.

## Common Borrower Scenarios in Sydney

**Property developers**: Need bridging finance to complete luxury apartment projects.

**SMEs**: Use caveat loans to pay suppliers or tax obligations.

**Investors**: Secure second mortgages to release equity from high-value assets.

**Builders**: Cover cashflow gaps while awaiting progress payments.

## Case Study: Rose Bay Developer

A boutique developer in Rose Bay faced settlement on a $5m property purchase but had not yet received funds from a completed townhouse project.

**Required**: $1.5m bridging loan.

**Security**: Investment property valued at $4m, first mortgage $2m.

**Combined LVR**: 87% requested, negotiated down to $1.2m loan (75% LVR).

**Outcome**: Loan settled in 6 days, developer completed purchase, repaid upon project sale.

This case highlights the importance of conservative LVRs and clear exits.

## Case Study: Sydney Logistics Firm

A logistics company based in Alexandria faced a $400k ATO tax debt, threatening its contracts with major retailers.

**Security**: Warehouse property valued at $3.5m with $1.5m first mortgage.

**Loan**: $450k caveat loan, interest capitalised.

**Exit**: Refinance into bank facility once financials were updated.

**Outcome**: Company avoided penalties, retained contracts, and refinanced within 4 months.

## Risks of Private Lending in Sydney

**High demand drives pricing**: Interest rates often 1–2% per month.

**Market volatility**: Property values can shift quickly.

**Exit delays**: If settlement slips, balances grow with capitalised interest.

**Legal complexity**: Priority deeds may be required for second mortgages.

## Practical Tips for Sydney Borrowers

**Prepare your file**: Title search, mortgage statements, exit evidence.

**Be realistic on LVRs**: Assume conservative property valuations.

**Choose the right product**: Caveat for urgent, second mortgage for larger projects.

**Plan your exit early**: Sales, refinance, or receivables must be credible.

**Engage advisors**: Legal and financial input avoids surprises.

Sydney's business landscape is fast-moving and competitive. Private lending provides flexible, fast solutions when banks can't deliver in time. Used strategically, it helps developers, SMEs, and investors bridge gaps, preserve contracts, and unlock opportunities.

<h1>Commercial Property Loan Calculator — Commercial Real Estate Financing in Australia</h1>
<p><em>Calculate your commercial property loan repayments and discuss tailored financing with a broker.</em></p>

<h2>Commercial property loan calculator: comprehensive overview</h2>
<p>If you're financing commercial property in Australia — whether purchasing, refinancing, or developing — this calculator and guide help you understand rates, terms, and total costs. Use the tools above to model different scenarios, then read on for eligibility, lender options, and how we structure competitive deals.</p>
<p><strong>What are commercial property loans?</strong> These are business-purpose finance facilities secured by first mortgage over commercial, industrial, or retail property. They differ from residential mortgages in structure, underwriting, and pricing. We connect businesses with banks, non-bank lenders, and private credit sources to secure optimal terms.</p>

<h2>When to use commercial property finance</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Property acquisition:</strong> Purchasing office, warehouse, retail, industrial, or mixed-use premises</li>
<li><strong>Owner-occupied premises:</strong> Buying property for your business to operate from; improves stability and builds equity</li>
<li><strong>Investment property:</strong> Acquiring commercial property to lease to tenants for rental income</li>
<li><strong>Refinancing:</strong> Replacing existing debt to access better rates, release equity, or consolidate facilities</li>
<li><strong>Development or renovation:</strong> Funding fitouts, expansions, or value-add refurbishments</li>
<li><strong>Portfolio consolidation:</strong> Combining multiple properties or facilities under one streamlined structure</li>
</ul>

<h2>Commercial property loan rates, fees & typical terms</h2>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr><th>Interest Rate</th><td>6.0%–10.0% p.a. (variable); banks typically 6-9%, alt lenders & private 8-12%+</td></tr>
<tr><th>Loan Term</th><td>1–5 years interest-only (IO) or principal & interest (P&I); refinance typically at end of IO period</td></tr>
<tr><th>LVR (Loan-to-Value)</th><td>Up to 65%–75% depending on lender, property type, lease strength (WALE), and borrower profile</td></tr>
<tr><th>Security</th><td>1st registered mortgage over commercial, industrial, or retail property</td></tr>
<tr><th>Establishment Fee</th><td>0.5%–2.0% of loan amount (banks lower; alt lenders higher)</td></tr>
<tr><th>Ongoing Fees</th><td>Monthly account keeping, annual review fees (varies by lender)</td></tr>
<tr><th>Legal & Valuation</th><td>$3,000-$8,000+ depending on complexity, location, property type</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Rates and terms vary significantly. Strong lease covenants, longer WALE, and blue-chip locations command better pricing. Owner-occupied properties may face different LVR limits vs investment properties.</p>

<h2>Eligibility & required documents</h2>
<h3>Standard requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Current ABN registration & photo ID for all directors/guarantors</li>
<li>2-3 years of business financials (P&L, balance sheet) or tax returns</li>
<li>Recent BAS statements (last 4-6 quarters)</li>
<li>6 months of business bank statements</li>
<li>Deposit evidence (typically 25-35% of purchase price or property value)</li>
<li>Rates notice and title search for the property</li>
<li>Contract of sale (if purchase) or current property details (if refinance)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Investment property additional requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lease agreements for all tenants</li>
<li>Rent roll showing income and WALE (weighted average lease expiry)</li>
<li>Property management agreement (if applicable)</li>
<li>Outgoings schedule (strata, council rates, insurance, maintenance)</li>
<li>Recent property valuation (if available)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Owner-occupied property additional requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Business plan or trading history showing ability to service loan</li>
<li>Demonstration of how property supports business operations</li>
<li>Future cash flow projections (for startups or expanding businesses)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Process & typical timelines</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial consultation & scenario assessment</strong> — Review objectives, property details, deposit, financial position (1-2 hours)</li>
<li><strong>Lender shortlist & indicative terms</strong> — Identify suitable lenders; obtain preliminary interest rates and LVR offers (2-5 business days)</li>
<li><strong>Formal application & documentation</strong> — Prepare credit pack; lender orders valuation (1 week)</li>
<li><strong>Valuation & credit assessment</strong> — Full property valuation completed; lender underwrites deal (1-2 weeks)</li>
<li><strong>Formal approval & conditions</strong> — Conditional approval issued with any outstanding requirements (few days)</li>
<li><strong>Satisfy conditions & legal documentation</strong> — Complete requirements; lawyers prepare loan documents (1-2 weeks)</li>
<li><strong>Settlement & drawdown</strong> — Registration of mortgage and fund transfer (settlement day)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Total timeline:</strong> Typically 3-6 weeks from application to settlement for standard transactions. Urgent deals can sometimes settle in 2-3 weeks with desktop valuations and streamlined lenders.</p>

<p><strong>Real case example:</strong> Melbourne-based logistics company acquired $1.8M warehouse property. Bank facility: 65% LVR ($1.17M loan), 5-year term IO then refinance, 7.2% p.a. variable rate. Application to settlement: 4 weeks. Establishment fee: 0.8% plus legals ($4,200). Strong lease (8 years WALE to related entity) supported approval.</p>

<h2>How we structure and negotiate commercial property loans</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lender selection strategy:</strong> Banks for vanilla deals & best rates; non-banks for faster settlement or complex scenarios; private credit for higher LVR or unique situations</li>
<li><strong>Rate & fee negotiation:</strong> Leverage our lender relationships to secure competitive pricing and reduce establishment fees</li>
<li><strong>Structure optimization:</strong> Choose between IO vs P&I, fixed vs variable, single vs split loans based on your business strategy</li>
<li><strong>LVR maximization:</strong> Position the deal to achieve maximum borrowing while maintaining approval certainty</li>
<li><strong>Covenant negotiation:</strong> Minimize restrictive financial covenants, reporting requirements, and prepayment penalties</li>
<li><strong>Exit planning:</strong> Ensure flexibility to refinance, sell, or restructure without prohibitive costs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bank vs non-bank vs private lenders: understanding your options</h2>
<h3>Major banks (ANZ, CBA, NAB, Westpac, etc.)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Strong financials, simple deals, A-grade property, longer relationships</li>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Lowest rates (6-8% p.a.), established processes, relationship banking benefits</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Slower approval, stricter serviceability tests, less flexible on complex structures</li>
<li><strong>Typical LVR:</strong> 60-70% for investment; up to 80% for owner-occupied (case-by-case)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Non-bank lenders (specialist commercial lenders)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Faster timelines, moderate complexity, newer businesses, B-grade property</li>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Quicker decisions (1-2 weeks), more flexible criteria, asset-focused underwriting</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Higher rates (7-10% p.a.), higher establishment fees, may require stronger security</li>
<li><strong>Typical LVR:</strong> 65-75% depending on property quality and business strength</li>
</ul>

<h3>Private credit / private lenders</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best for:</strong> High LVR needs, complex situations, credit impairments, urgent settlements</li>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Highest LVR (up to 80%+), fastest approval (days), creative structures</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Highest rates (9-14% p.a.), higher fees, shorter terms (1-3 years), more covenants</li>
<li><strong>Typical LVR:</strong> 70-80% (sometimes higher with strong asset backing)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding commercial property underwriting</h2>
<h3>What lenders assess</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Property quality & location:</strong> CBD vs suburban, A-grade vs B/C grade buildings, exposure to main roads, parking, amenity</li>
<li><strong>Lease strength (investment properties):</strong> WALE (weighted average lease expiry), tenant covenants, rent reviews, vacancy risk</li>
<li><strong>Income coverage ratio (ICR):</strong> Net rental income ÷ annual debt service; typically need 1.3x-1.5x+ for approval</li>
<li><strong>Serviceability (owner-occupied):</strong> Business cash flow ability to cover loan repayments plus operating expenses</li>
<li><strong>LVR & security buffer:</strong> Lower LVR reduces lender risk; provides cushion against valuation fluctuations</li>
<li><strong>Borrower track record:</strong> Business trading history, credit file, previous property deals, director experience</li>
<li><strong>Exit strategy:</strong> How will the loan be repaid or refinanced at the end of the term?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key underwriting considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>WALE analysis:</strong> Longer weighted average lease expiry improves pricing and LVR; <3 years considered weak</li>
<li><strong>Tenant quality:</strong> Government, ASX-listed, or blue-chip tenants command best terms; SME tenants require lower LVR</li>
<li><strong>Property type risk profile:</strong> Office & industrial favored; retail under pressure; specialty property (e.g., medical, childcare) needs niche lenders</li>
<li><strong>Valuation method:</strong> Capitalization approach for investment properties (NOI ÷ cap rate); comparable sales for others</li>
<li><strong>Conditions precedent:</strong> Full valuation, building inspections, environmental reports, lease assignment consents</li>
<li><strong>Financial covenants:</strong> ICR maintenance, financial reporting requirements, restrictions on further debt or asset sales</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<dl>
<div>
<dt><strong>What's the difference between commercial and residential property loans?</strong></dt>
<dd>Commercial loans are assessed on property income and business serviceability, not personal income. They have higher rates, lower LVRs, shorter terms, and are regulated differently (not covered by consumer credit laws for business purposes).</dd>
</div>
<div>
<dt><strong>Can I get 80% LVR on commercial property?</strong></dt>
<dd>Rarely with banks; more common with non-bank or private lenders, but expect higher rates (9-12% p.a.) and stronger covenants. Some lenders offer lender's mortgage insurance (LMI) to enable higher LVR.</dd>
</div>
<div>
<dt><strong>What is WALE and why does it matter?</strong></dt>
<dd>WALE (Weighted Average Lease Expiry) measures the average remaining lease term across all tenants. Longer WALE (5+ years) indicates stable income, improving rates and LVR. Short WALE means refinancing or vacancy risk.</dd>
</div>
<div>
<dt><strong>Should I choose interest-only or principal & interest?</strong></dt>
<dd>IO is common for commercial property (preserves cash flow, interest is tax-deductible). Many lenders offer 1-5 years IO, then require refinancing or conversion to P&I. Your strategy depends on exit plans and tax position.</dd>
</div>
<div>
<dt><strong>How quickly can I get commercial property finance?</strong></dt>
<dd>Banks: 4-6 weeks. Non-banks: 2-4 weeks. Private lenders: 1-2 weeks for urgent deals. Desktop valuations and pre-approvals can accelerate timelines.</dd>
</div>
<div>
<dt><strong>Do I need a deposit, and how much?</strong></dt>
<dd>Yes, typically 25-35% of property value (to achieve 65-75% LVR). Some lenders go higher if cross-collateralizing other property or with strong business cash flow. Stamp duty and costs are additional.</dd>
</div>
<div>
<dt><strong>Can I use an SMSF to buy commercial property?</strong></dt>
<dd>Yes, SMSFs can borrow to purchase commercial property via Limited Recourse Borrowing Arrangement (LRBA). Specialist SMSF lenders required; different LVR limits (typically 50-70%).</dd>
</div>
<div>
<dt><strong>What if my business is new or has limited financials?</strong></dt>
<dd>Focus on asset-based lenders who prioritize property quality and lease strength over business history. Higher deposit (30-40%) improves approval chances. Private lenders more flexible but costlier.</dd>
</div>
<div>
<dt><strong>Fixed or variable interest rate?</strong></dt>
<dd>Most commercial loans are variable. Fixed rates available but usually 0.5-1.5% higher and less flexible. Consider split loans (part fixed, part variable) for balance.</dd>
</div>

<h2>Alternative commercial property financing options</h2>

<h2>Common mistakes that delay commercial property approvals</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insufficient deposit:</strong> Underestimating total costs (stamp duty, legals, contingency); running short on settlement</li>
<li><strong>Weak lease documentation:</strong> Short WALE, informal agreements, tenants behind on rent; lenders require formal leases</li>
<li><strong>Poor property condition:</strong> Deferred maintenance, building code issues; valuer discounts heavily; lender declines</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete financials:</strong> Missing BAS quarters, unaudited accounts, cash sales not declared; raises red flags</li>
<li><strong>Unrealistic LVR expectations:</strong> Requesting 80% LVR with 2-star property and weak tenant; misaligned with lender appetite</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring serviceability:</strong> Assuming rental income alone suffices; lenders stress-test and apply coverage ratios</li>
<li><strong>Late valuation booking:</strong> Not coordinating valuer access; delays approval and settlement</li>
<li><strong>Environmental risks:</strong> Contamination, flooding, bushfire zones not disclosed; discovered late; deal collapses</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical tips to secure better rates and faster approvals</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prepare financials meticulously:</strong> Complete BAS, clean bank statements, reconciled accounts; shows lender you're organized</li>
<li><strong>Secure lease documentation early:</strong> Formal signed leases, rent reviews documented, tenant references; strengthens deal</li>
<li><strong>Obtain independent valuation upfront:</strong> Demonstrates realistic pricing expectations; reduces lender surprises</li>
<li><strong>Highlight lease WALE & tenant quality:</strong> Emphasize long leases (5+ years), government/corporate tenants; directly improves pricing</li>
<li><strong>Show clear business case:</strong> Explain how property supports business operations (owner-occupied) or investment strategy (investment)</li>
<li><strong>Negotiate multiple offers:</strong> Approach 2-3 lenders simultaneously; creates competitive tension; better terms</li>
<li><strong>Request rate review clause:</strong> If rates drop mid-term, negotiate ability to request review; keeps you competitive</li>
<li><strong>Structure for flexibility:</strong> Ensure loan allows refinancing, early repayment, partial repayment without excessive fees</li>
<li><strong>Consider offset accounts:</strong> Some lenders offer offset facilities; park surplus cash to reduce interest costs</li>
<li><strong>Timing matters:</strong> Allow 4-6 weeks for standard bank approvals; use non-bank if settlement deadline tight</li>
<li><strong>Engage specialists:</strong> Commercial property lawyers, quantity surveyors, experienced brokers; upfront cost saves headaches</li>
<li><strong>Plan for refinancing:</strong> Commercial loans typically 3-5 years; start refinancing conversations 6 months before expiry</li>
<li><strong>Monitor market conditions:</strong> Rate cycles, lender appetite changes; refinancing during favorable periods saves significantly</li>
</ul>

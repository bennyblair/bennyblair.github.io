## bridging loan guide: quick overview

If you're weighing up bridging loan options for your business, this guide breaks down how it works in Australia, when it's useful, what it costs, and how we structure it with lenders.

**What is a bridging loan?** It's a commercial finance solution used by Australian businesses. We arrange and negotiate terms with lenders, then coordinate credit and settlement.

## When to use it (Australian SMEs)

- Time‑sensitive transactions (deadlines, settlements, supplier payments)
- Funding tied to a clear exit (sale, refinance, receivables, progress claim)
- Working capital gaps (seasonality, stock build, long debtor terms)
- Where property, invoices, inventory or plant & equipment can support the facility

## Rates, fees & typical terms

| Interest | 0.8%–1.8% per month (interest-only) |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Term | 1–12 months (extensions possible) |
| LVR / Advance | Up to ~70% 1st mortgage; ~55–65% 2nd (asset/val dependent) |
| Security | 1st/2nd mortgage over investment or commercial property; caveat |
| Typical fees | Establishment 1.5%–3.5% + legal/valuation |

These are indicative only and vary by lender, asset quality and exit.

## Eligibility & documents

- ABN & photo ID
- Rates notice & title search
- Purpose & exit strategy
- Assets & liabilities
- Leases (if income-supporting)
- Valuation (if required)

## Process & timelines

1. **Outline objectives & exit**
2. **Price/structure options**
3. **Credit pack & conditions**
4. **Signing**
5. **Funding**

**Case vignette.** NSW wholesaler used *bridging loan financing* to raise $1,200,000. Structure: approx 65% LVR, 6-month term. Indicative terms in 24–48h; settlement in 7 business days. Fees: 3.0% establishment + legals. Security and pricing always depend on the asset and exit.

## How we structure and negotiate with lenders

- Map the lender landscape and shortlist realistic structures
- Negotiate pricing and conditions with credit teams
- Coordinate valuation, legals and settlement
- Keep the facility strictly commercial (no consumer credit)

## FAQs

**Is bridging loan financing regulated under NCCP in Australia?**
For business‑purpose loans, NCCP consumer credit rules generally do not apply. We arrange commercial finance only.

**How fast can funding be arranged?**
Indicative terms are often achievable in 24–48 hours for straightforward scenarios. Settlement timing depends on security, docs and valuation.

**What security is usually required?**
Commonly 1st/2nd mortgage over investment or commercial property; caveat. The exact structure is lender‑ and asset‑dependent.

**What documents should I prepare up front?**
Photo ID, ABN, BAS/financials, bank statements, rates notice/title, plus asset/contract evidence.

**Can this help with ATO/tax or supplier arrears?**
Often yes, provided the exit is clear and security supports the risk.
